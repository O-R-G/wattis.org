In addition to the articles, the publication includes a Foreword by Leigh Markopoulos, an introductory essay by Simone Fattal, an interview with Adnan by Jesi Khadivi and Heidi Rabben, and a newly commissioned essay by Andrew Weiner, all responding to Adnanʼs journalism and its fraught sociopolitical context. It also includes a copy of the exhibition guide with writing on the exhibition by Antonia Marsh and on Adnan\'s writing by Rebecca Roy. \r\n\r\nThe articles selected for <i>The Ninth Page</i> challenge preconceptions about Beirut\'s political climate in this moment while also offering up a portrait of an entire cosmopolitan, international worldview that is social and cultural as often as it is political. The diverse subjects Adnan covers document the rich cultural scene of Beirut on the brink of civil war, a political cataclysm addressed with great force later in Adnanʼs landmark books <i>Sitt Marie Rose (1978)</i> and <i>The Arab Apocalypse (1980)</i>. By focusing on her time as a journalist, <i>The Ninth Page</i> fills a discursive gap in the chronicling of Adnan\'s written history, enriching her painting and writing practices. Images of the original newspaper articles are also projected in the exhibition space.\r\nWords and Places: Etel Adnan is the first large-scale institutional exhibition of work by the Lebanese writer, poet, and painter Etel Adnan, spanning six decades of her artistic practice. Born in Beirut in 1925 to a Christian Greek mother and a Muslim Syrian father, Adnan has spent her life between places––Beirut, Paris, and the Bay Area––negotiating their different cultures and languages, as well as her distinctive position among them. This experience of displacement deeply informs her work, which similarly ranges between mediums and formats.\r\n\r\nThis catalogue is available for academic purposes only.

The brisk pace of the 50 displays reflects the varied and constantly changing fabric of this relatively young country and its multilayered, shifting national identity.\r\n\r\nThe title is a reference to an exhibition of the same name that was curated by the artist collaborative Group Material at the 1985 biennial of the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York.

This exhibition is realized in collaboration with CCA\'s undergraduate Graphic Design Program, the Graduate Program in Design, and Jon Sueda. Sueda is a Graphic Design professor at CCA and founder of the San Francisco design practice Stripe. Wide White Space is the second installment in The Way Beyond Art, a series of exhibitions at the Wattis that closely integrates the institute\'s programs with CCA\'s non-fine arts faculty and curricula.\r\n\r\nThe title Wide White Space refers to the name of a radical art space in Antwerp that, though it existed for only a decade, came to define contemporary art in the late 1960s and early 1970s. This exhibition likewise aims to investigate the possibilities for how empty space, whether the white cube or the blank page, can be transformed into something more complex. The name of the larger program, The Way Beyond Art, refers to the title of a book written by the visionary German art historian Alexander Dorner, who advocated in the early 20th century for a closer dialogue among different artistic disciplines. He is best known for his collaboration with the Constructivist artist El Lissitzky on the Abstract Cabinet (1927) at the Landesmuseum Hannover, Germany, a unique, specially constructed space that explored a new form of multidisciplinarity produced by juxtaposing art, fashion, design, film, and literature.\r\n\r\nThis catalog was produced by Jon Sueda / Stripe.',NULL),(49,1,'2014-07-27 16:11:56','2014-07-27 18:36:58',50,'Give Them the Picture',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',NULL,NULL,'2014-07-27 20:11:00',NULL,NULL,'Graduate Program in Curatorial Practice at CCA and CCA Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts, 2011\r\nPaperback, 203 pages\r\n$20.00','Give Them the Picture is a literary extension of the Curatorial Practice thesis exhibition currently on view in the Wattis.
