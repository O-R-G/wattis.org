Esteemed West Coast pop artist Ed Ruscha playfully upends the genre of 
self-portraiture in a twofold fashion. Ruscha not only foregoes the 
category’s traditional composition—a straight-on depiction of the face 
or body—but his diptych of two images, which depict nothing more than 
the artist's forearm and are separated by more than 50 years, offers 
little evidence of aging or change.<br /><br />
