Initiated by Larry Rinder, it was originally called the CCAC Institute of Exhibitions and Public Programming. In 2002, it was renamed the CCA Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts. In 2013, it moved from CCA\'s main campus to its own building a few blocks away. Subsequently to Rinder\'s directorship, the Wattis has been led by Ralph Rugoff (2000 - 2006), Jens Hoffmann (2006 - 2012), and Anthony Huberman (2013 - present). <br><br>Upon its founding in 1998, the Wattis also absorbed <a href=\"http://www.wattis.org/capp\">Capp Street Project</a>, one of the earliest and longest-running artist-in-residence programs in the country, founded in 1983 by Ann Hatch. Building on that history, the Wattis Institute hosts a <a href=\"/capp-street-project/capp-street-artists-1984-a\">Capp Street Artist-in-Residence</a> every year and invites an artist to come live and work in San Francisco for a semester, to teach a graduate seminar at CCA, and to present an exhibition. More about that<a href=\"http://www.wattis.org/capp\"> here</a>.<br><br>The Wattis Institute has also collaborated with students and faculty members in other programs at CCA, including the Graduate Program in <a href=\"https://www.cca.edu/academics/graduate/curatorial-practice\" target=\"new\">Curatorial Practice</a>, the Graduate Program in <a href=\"https://www.cca.edu/academics/graduate/fine-arts\" target=\"new\">Fine Arts</a>, and the Graduate Program in <a href=\"https://www.cca.edu/academics/graduate/visual-critical-studies\" target=\"new\">Visual and Critical Studies</a>, among others.<br><br><i>The CCA Wattis Institute program is generously supported by The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, The Westridge Foundation, Daniel and Manizeh Rimer, San Francisco Grants for the Arts, Penny and Jim Coulter, Gina and Stuart Peterson, Jonathan Gans and Abigail Turin, and CCA Wattis Institute’s Curator’s Forum.

Her departure point is a scene from <i>Les Demoiselles de Rochefort</i>, a 1967 musical film by Jacques Demy, starring Catherine Deneuve and Gene Kelly. In several scenes of the film, Demy uses artworks as props to help build his characters and their relationships to the world.  Instead of being independent works of art, the objects perform cameos or stand-ins for the film’s plot, such as a portrait of an “ideal woman.”<br><br><i>The starting point for the project is to pose two questions. One is to examine how the perception of a critical failure or a lack of success—or the identification of problems—can actually ignite closer interest. The second begins with the observation that contemporary visual art routinely leverages other disciplines such as literature, dance, film, magazines, fashion, interior design, architecture to add value and extend the notion of art. But what if this cultural relation is reciprocal: what is the status and efficacy of art moving in the other direction, or playing a supporting role such as in </i>Les Demoiselles<i>? What if an exhibition embraces the notion of art performing a supporting role?</i> (Nairy Baghramian)<br><br>To address these questions, Baghramian splits the gallery in two: on one side is a traditional white wall, and the other side is “storage.” One by one, each work is displayed on the white wall for a short time: they maintain their autonomy as works of art and assert themselves as the protagonists of their own story. Each work then joins the others in storage and becomes another “prop,” ready to serve a supporting role in someone else’s story.

Behind all his works is a version of the artist himself, often presented in crisis, with a punctured self-reflexivity that nevertheless vitalizes and exceeds its powerfully apparent artifice. Since his exhibition at Chisenhale Gallery, London (2012), one consistently deployed visual motif has been a high-resolution animation of his own head, often decapitated, highlighting the process of abstraction between artistic labour and the delivered and mediated artistic self. An important and under-valued component in Atkins’ videos and performances is his careful design of sound, in which he evens out unlikely influences — from Baroque choral music to contemporary improvisation — into hissing sonic surfaces that push his texts into spaces beyond the spoken word.<br><br>Atkins’ exhibition at Mainz features a number of recent works, including his most recent video Ribbons, which was co-commissioned by Kunsthalle Zurich and The Serpentine, London, where Atkins staged exhibitions earlier this year. Having followed Atkins’ work for a long period (since his MA exhibition at the Slade School of Art in 2009), I believe that this recent trio of exhibitions marks a high point in his work to date: essayistic long-form videos are combined with shorter animations — for instance, a looped animation of his own bloodied head rolling down a stairwell — as well as ink drawings mounted on architectural panels, and multi-channel sound installations. Atkins can be considered to be one of the most celebrated young artists working today, and as the scale and status of his institutional collaborators increases, his work adapts in the best possible ways, all the while retaining his skepticism and seriousness.<br><br>His exhibition in Mainz continues until 28 September 2014. <br><br>— <i>Jamie Stevens</i><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>',NULL),(106,1,'2014-08-02 01:34:47','2014-08-02 01:34:47',NULL,'Untitled',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'untitled',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','',NULL),(107,1,'2014-08-02 02:19:19','2016-12-26 21:10:21',499,'Saturday, September 13, 2014',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'saturday-september-13-2014',NULL,'2014-09-13 15:00:00','2014-09-13 17:00:00',NULL,NULL,_binary '. . .

The film charts the journey of an artist-filmmaker who is led astray from her attempts to make a documentary in Los Angeles by the mysterious history of a deceased male artist named Amboy. <i>Amboy</i>’s storyline is expressed with a disorienting array of cinematic strategies taken from feature films, documentaries, B-movies, and home-video style recordings. The conflation of these approaches takes place in an exhibition environment: one that includes photographic prints and readymade objects taken from the actual site of Amboy, a ghost town in the Mojave desert that serves as the central location of the film. <br><br>Scholz, a painter and filmmaker, edited, shot and directed the film in a number of semi-improvised sequences cowritten and coproduced with von Schlegell, art theorist and science fiction author, encorporating an expansive cast of actors and collaborators from the worlds of art, film, music, and literature. Scholz and von Schlegell invited a number of musicians—including Stephen Malkmus, Holy Shit, and Kath Bloom—to provide <i>Amboy</i>’s soundtrack, which at times is performed in-camera, in proximity to the film’s narrative action. Actors in <i>Amboy</i> include Paul Giamatti, Eleanor Antin, Penny Arcade, Chris Kraus, Andrea Fraser, Colm Tóibín, Leslie Allison and Lily Benson.

More recently, thermodynamics has taught us that the hotter something gets, the more erratically it behaves and the more unreliable it becomes. To guarantee the stability of any system, therefore, means to follow one basic formula: minimize friction and maximize flow. <br><br>Sam Lewitt switches that around. His work adds weight and materiality to systems that would otherwise prefer to run smoothly and invisibly. This exhibition generates heat—it maximizes friction and minimizes flow. <br><br>The artist has redirected the building’s energy use from light to heat. On the ground are flexible heating circuits Lewitt has had fabricated, which are much larger versions of Kapton/copper composite heaters that are used to maintain and regulate highly targeted temperatures inside communication devices. The objects draw their power from long cords coming down from the gallery’s lighting track. The electricity usually used by light bulbs now runs into the sculptures and along the lines etched into their surfaces, generating heat.

Encompassing zines, photography, collage, video montage, documentary film, and sound collage, the exhibition presents its artists and musicians as subcultural anthropologists, documenting a world at the brink of disaster.<br><br>The exhibition takes as its starting point the aftermath of the Vietnam War and Ronald Reagan’s first bid for the presidency. Under the leadership of Reagan, California had become ground zero for neoconservative attacks on the social contract as well as the context for an array of violent episodes, including the Manson Family murders, the SLA abductions and bombings, the assassination of Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk, and the Jonestown massacre. To some of those who lived through it, the future looked bleak—a void, indeed.<br><br>The resulting desperation prompted artists and musicians to create powerful, visually striking work that reflected their disillusionment, and to disseminate it in new ways. New access to portable recording equipment, VCRs, and photocopy machines allowed them to unravel top-down mass media control over communication. By appropriating and mocking the imagery of newspapers and TV in cheap, reproducible media, artists created an alternative account of the period.<br><br>In doing so they formed a self-invented community. Informed by extensive archival research among a network of artists, musicians, writers, and collectors, the exhibition charts a constellation of California artists and art forms that—despite certain of its participants later achieving a more traditional art-world success—have until now received little serious attention, beyond an oversimplified nostalgia for the punk moment.<br><br>Publications and artists included in the exhibition are Melody Sumner Carnahan, Randy Hussong, Cameron Jamie, Negativland, NOMAG (Los Angeles), Raymond Pettibon, Ruby Ray, Search & Destroy (San Francisco), Greta Snider, Matt Heckert, Survival Research Laboratories,  Joe Rees/TargetVideo77, Vile (San Francisco), and We Got Power (Los Angeles).<br><br>An accompanying publication reproduces works from the exhibition and supplementary ephemeral material used in the making of several pieces, as well a curatorial project inspired by Melody Sumner Carnahan’s <i>The Form</i> (1979).<br><br>Events:<br><a href=\"\">March 11, 7 pm</a>: a performance by Brontez Purnell<br><a href=\"/calendar/friday-march-18-2016\">March 18, 6 pm</a>: a screening of film and video works curated by San Francisco–based filmmaker Craig Baldwin<br><a href=\"/calendar/friday-april-1-2016\">April 1, 6 pm</a>: a panel discussion<br><a href=\"/calendar/friday-april-8-2016\">April 8,  6 pm</a>: a catalogue launch<br><br>This exhibition is curated by the 2016 class of the Graduate Program in Curatorial Practice at California College of the Arts: Shelley Carr, Meeyung Chung, Ziying Duan, Hannah Novillo Erickson, Teresa Goodman, Rashel Ruixuan Li, and Kathryn Wade.<br><br>Press:<br><br><a href=\'http://wattis.org/media/00847.pdf\' target=\'new\'><i>KQED Arts</i></a>, by Kevin L.

What do I satisfy?”</i><br><br>(<i>Official Welcome</i>, 2001)<br> <br>So asks Andrea Fraser, in character as Andrea Fraser (before speaking as various other artists, patrons, and administrators, and amalgamations of them), in her 2001 performance <i>Official Welcome</i>. Fraser’s 30-year body of work can, without exception, be located back into the reframing and close examination of these two questions. Fraser’s artistic practice has emerged in multiple formats – performances, videos, installations, workshops, texts, activism, teaching – but is consistently connected by her direct and trenchant address of the spaces and relations that constitute the field of art.

The film offers no solutions; it merely presents life — sometimes hauntingly bleak, sometimes filled with transcendent joy and gentle humor. <br><br>After the screening, director <a href=\"\">Charles Burnett</a> is in conversation with <a href=\"\">Jacqueline Francis</a>, Associate Professor of Fine Arts and Visual and Critical Studies at California College of the Arts.<br><br>The event is introduced by Steve Polta, Artistic Director of San Francisco Cinematheque. <br><br>This event is the third event in our <a href=\"\">year-long season</a> about and around the work of David Hammons.<br><br>///Event begins at 7:15 pm<br><br>Space is limited.',''),(364,1,'2016-07-22 01:18:31','2016-07-28 19:15:05',215,'Andrea Fraser 5 published texts',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'andrea-fraser-5-published-texts',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Our year-long season about and around the work of Andrea Fraser has come to an end.

That’s just not how they work. They are too abstract, too invisible, and move too quickly. They don’t live anywhere, but only run by and pass through, and no matter how old they are, they are always light years ahead.  They do what they want, whenever they want. And under specific circumstances, at specific times, in specific places, to specific people, for specific reasons, they make their presence known. <br><br>In the Congo Basin in Central Africa, they are called <i>minkisi</i>. They are the hiding place for people’s souls.<br><br>David Hammons is a spirit catcher. He walks the streets the way an improviser searches for notes, looking for those places and objects where dormant spirits go to hide, and empowers them again. He knows about the streetlamps and the mailboxes where the winos hide their bottles in shame. Hammons calls it <i>tragic magic</i>—the art of converting pain into poetry.<br><br>[image1]<br><br>Much has been said about the materials Hammons uses in his work.  Most are taken from the street and cost very little—greasy paper bags, shovels, ice, cigarettes, rubber tubes, hair, rocks, basketballs, fried food, bikes, torn plastic tarps, Kool-Aid. Some of them are (knowingly) borrowed from the vocabulary of other artists, while others are closely tied to his own life and chosen surroundings in Harlem.  Much has also been said about the meaning of his work—its arguments, its politics, what it’s “about.” And while much of what has been said has been useful, it has also been partly beside the point.<br><br>Materials are something one can <i>see</i>, and arguments are something one can <i>understand</i>, and that’s just not what Hammons is after. He’s interested in how much those wine bottles still somehow contain the lips that once drank from them.  He’s after the pun on <i>spirit</i>—as in the drink, but also as in the presence of something far more abstract.  <br><br><i>Black hair is the oldest hair in the world. You’ve got tons of people’s spirits in your hands when you work with that stuff.</i><br><br>[image3]<br><br>If Hammons is suspicious of all that is visible, it might be because the visible, in America, is all that is white. It’s all those Oscar winners, all those museum trustees, and all those faces on all those dollar bills. Some artists work to denounce, reveal, or illustrate racial injustice, and to make visible those who are not. Hammons, on the other hand, prefers invisibility—or placing the visible out of reach. He doesn’t have a lesson to teach or a point to prove, and his act of protest is simply <i>to abstract</i>, because that’s what will make the visible harder to recognize and the intelligible harder to understand. <br><br>If Duchamp was uninterested in what the eye can see, Hammons is oppressed by it—it’s not the same thing. <br><br>[image4]<br><br><i>I’m trying to make abstract art out of my experience, just like Thelonius Monk.</i><br><br>For Hammons, musicians have always been both the model and the front line. When George Lewis says that “the truth of improvisation involves survival,” it’s because improv musicians look for a way forward, one note at a time, with no map to guide them and with no rules or languages to follow other than ones they invent and determine themselves. It forces them to analyze where they are and forces them to do something about it, on their own terms. Doesn’t get much more political than that.<br><br>Or, as Miles Davis once put it, “I do not play jazz.” He plays something that invents its own vocabulary—a vocabulary that is shared only by those who don’t need to know what to call it or how to contain it. And just as Miles Davis doesn’t play jazz, David Hammons doesn’t make art. <br><br>[image5]<br><br><i>I’m trying to create a hieroglyphics that was definitely black.</i><br><br>Hammons goes looking for spirits in music, poetry, and dirt. He knows they like to hide inside of sounds, lodge themselves between words or within puns, and linger around the used-up and the seemingly worthless. He knows he’s caught some when he succeeds in <i>rousing the rubble</i> and gets it to make its presence felt. Like Noah Purifoy, he ignores the new and the expensive in favor of the available. Like Federico Fellini, he spends his time in the bowels of culture and makes them sing.<br><br>[image2]<br><br>There are the materials that make the art—those are the foot soldiers—but there is also the attitude that makes the artist. Hammons has his way of thinking and his way of behaving, which is once again not something one sees or necessarily understands, but is something that makes its presence known, the way spirits make their presence felt.  There will be some who won’t recognize it and others who do—and his work is meant only for those who see themselves in it. <br><br><i>Did you ever see Elvis Presley’s resume? Or John Lennon’s resume? Fuck that resume shit. </i><br><br>Ornette was Ornette because of what he could blow, but also because he never gave into other people’s agendas or expectations. <br><br>What matters even more than having your own agenda is letting others know that it doesn’t fit theirs. “To keep my rhythm,” as Hammons puts it, “there’s always a fight, with any structure.” The stakes are real because should you let your guard down, “they got rhythms for you,” and you’ll soon be thinking just like they do. And in a white and racist America, in a white and racist art world, Hammons doesn’t want to be thinking just like most people do. His is a recalcitrant politics of presence: where he doesn’t seem to belong, he appears; where he does belong, he vanishes.<br><br>In short: don’t play a game whose management you don’t control. <br><br>[image6]<br><br><i>That’s the only way you have to treat people with money—you have to let these people know that your agenda is light years beyond their thinking patterns.</i><br><br>The Whitney Biennial? <i>I don’t like the job description.</i> A major museum retrospective? <i>Get back to me with something I can’t understand.</i> <br><br>Exhibitions are too clean and make too much sense—plus the very authority of many mainstream museums is premised on values that Hammons doesn’t consider legitimate or at least does not share.  He is far more interested in walking and talking with Jr., a man living on the streets of the East Village, who taught him about how the homeless divide up their use of space according to lines marked by the positioning of bricks on a wall.  Those lines have <i>teeth</i>. In a museum, art is stripped of all its menace.<br><br>[image7]<br><br>The painter Jack Whitten once explained how music became so central to black American life with this allegory:<br> <br><i>When my white slave masters discovered that my drum was a subversive instrument they took it from me…. The only instrument available was my body, so I used my skin: I clapped my hands, slapped my thighs, and stomped my feet in dynamic rhythms.</i><br><br>David Hammons began with his skin.  He pressed his skin onto paper to make prints.  Over the subsequent five decades, he has found his drum. <br><br>[image8]<br><br><br><i>Anthony Huberman is the Director and Chief Curator of CCA Wattis Institute and was the Founding Director of The Artist\'s Institute</i>.<br>',''),(369,1,'2016-08-24 23:09:18','2016-09-21 19:50:19',457,'Saturday, September 10, 2016',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'saturday-september-10-2016',NULL,'2016-09-10 14:00:00','2016-09-10 17:00:00',NULL,NULL,_binary '...

Unfettered joy surrounds sports, no matter whether games result in defeat or in victory. Legends are held in the hearts of elders and recounted to friends and family members in extreme detail. The National Basketball Association is in its own way a royal court, complete with the tallest people in the world at the center. The rags-to-riches stories of NBA players inspire generations of young boys who will most likely never enter the royal halls of elite athletes. Nevertheless, sports are the biggest leveler in a class-based society, an arena where privileged training resources cannot always triumph over impoverished full-hearted athletes. These are important dreams in this country, dreams that informed <i>Higher Goals</i>, Hammons’s first basketball work, which was erected as a temporary public artwork in Brooklyn’s Cadman Plaza Park over a period of eight weeks in 1986.<br><br>[image1]<br><br><i>It takes five to play on a team, but there are thousands who want to play—not everyone will make it, but even if they don’t at least they tried.</i> (David Hammons)<br><br>The installation of <i>Higher Goals</i> was a performance and ritual that recalled a tribal ceremony. Hammons and his collaborators came to the site with their faces painted and bodies adorned with feathers as they ceremoniously carried and then erected huge poles with basketball hoops attached. These actions recall the Native American Sundance, where participants cut a tall thin tree down from the forest, carry it ritualistically, and reinstall it at the dance site. Hammons pointedly paints high-contrast patterning on the poles—sometimes identified as Islamic patterning, but also akin to Australian aboriginal painting, famous for the abstract depiction of Dreamtime, a concept of reality formed in one’s nighttime dreams. Hammons is quite aware of the potency and realities formed in Aboriginal Dreamtime. These basketball hoops and poles rise 30 feet high in their elegance.  They are completely unattainable: not even the tallest player can make this basket—such is a metaphor for a knife that cuts both ways on the spectrum of dreams. <br><br>The sites of the Brooklyn park and later a Harlem location where the piece was reinstalled gave Hammons a diverse audience as far from the center of the art world as possible. Harlem is the rich cultural center influenced by the Studio Museum, but also  it is home to the famous Rucker’s Park basketball tournament, where street athletes with legendary skills can compete with NBA players, who arrive unannounced.  The Rucker’s tournament gives star athletes who did not follow the traditional route to the NBA a second chance. The poles in a sense came “home.” <br><br>These hand-painted poles display empathy, in direct contrast to Hammons’s seamless ironic pieces. He toggles back and forth between dynamics of sincerity and biting social commentary, providing a lens for one audience and a mirror for another. These two are interchangeable, depending on the time and place for Hammons’s work. In a 1995 <i>Frieze</i> article, Coco Fusco and Christian Hayes wrote:<br><br><i>No account of Hammons’ art is entirely devoid of references to his streetwise, resolutely anti-elitist persona. He has become infamous for his acerbic appraisals of high art, and his willed cultivation of a split between a black interpretative community to which he directs his messages, and a now admiring (once indifferent) white art world he loves to snub, tease and confuse.</i><br><br>The mirror and the lens are two of the most potent tools used by David Hammons, and are most effectively employed in his basketball hoop works.<br><br>In 2002, Hammons made a glass crystal basketball hoop, which David Zwirner purchased at auction for $8 million in 2013. This piece is as elegant as it is baroque. The domesticated hoop glows with a pink light and is deliberately fanciful. The elaborately detailed handiwork of the piece contrasts with Hammons’s more minimal works. Who is the audience for this hoop? An aspiring middle class or an already established, moneyed household? <br><br>[image2]<br><br>Hammons was well aware of the market value of his work, and this rarefied sculpture is both ironic and lovely. Basketball has certainly gained in its own disparate economic stratosphere since Hammons’s production of <i>Higher Goals</i>.  Is Hammons thinking about this? As its sale price indicates, only the 1% can afford to own the work. Does Hammons consider the sale gesture itself a work of art? Would Hammons have preferred to sell the work to an affluent basketball star like Shaquille O’Neal? Would the identities of either man send different signals to the efficacy of this work of art? We do not see evidence of wholesale mass reaction to this work, as it is mute, quite unlike the voice in <i>How Ya Like Me Now?</i>, a portrait of Jesse Jackson as a white man.  <br><br>The Mnuchin Gallery in New York recently exhibited Hammons’s 1997 basketball hoop alongside a photograph of an all-white men’s basketball team in 1936, the same year African American track star Jesse Owens represented the United States in the Olympics. Again, Hammons provides viewers with the lens and the mirror, showing Americans both how much and how little the conversations around race have changed. Hammons understands that sport and art are dual entities occupying the soul of America. <br><br><br><i>Kim Anno is a painter, photographer, and video artist.

For the next five years he studied art while attending several schools in LA, among them Chouinard Art Institute (now California Institute of the Arts) and the Otis Art Institute, where he took a drawing class with the painter and printmaker Charles White. Prior to meeting White, Hammons says he had never encountered a successful black artist, and thus White made a great impression on the young artist. Hammons was particularly drawn to White’s figurative work that possessed “an agonized kind of look.” (1) During this nascent period of his artistic practice, Hammons became involved with the Black Arts Movement (BAM), centered in the Watts neighborhood from 1965 to 1976. Work associated with the BAM was characterized as image-based and socially motivated, or as art historian Kellie Jones notes, “[it was] figurative and commented on U.S. racism.” (2) Hammons was among the leading figures to come out of this movement in the late 1960s, frequently exhibiting at the Brockman Gallery and Gallery 32.<br><br>From the start Hammons’s work was politically driven and rooted in the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements—perhaps an inescapable aspect of his coming of age in and around Watts during the 1960s. It hardly seems insignificant that Hammons started making his first mature works of art, his body prints, in 1968—one of the most violent, politically charged years in recent American history: Martin Luther King was assassinated, President Nixon was elected, and protests against the Vietnam War reached unprecedented levels, escalating in the U.S. with the riots at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. It is not surprising then, that all of the aforementioned events would inform the subject matter of Hammons’s body prints. One could even say the body prints—specifically those that incorporate imagery of the American flag—were the most overtly political works Hammons would make over the course of his fifty-year career. As time progressed, Hammons’s work would become increasingly ambiguous and resistant to easy interpretation, despite consistently retaining a unique brand of irony and critical edge.<br><br>[image1]<br><br>In the body prints, Hammons marries his interests in graphic art and performance. In order to make the monoprints, he coated his body (along with his clothes and hair) in margarine and then rolled his torso and limbs onto a large piece of illustration board, printing the image by pressing his body onto the smooth surface of paper, often arrayed on the floor. About this very physical act, he has stated, “When I lie down on the paper which is first placed on the floor, I have to carefully decide how to get up after I have made the impression that I want. Sometimes I lie there for perhaps three minutes or even longer just figuring out how I can get off the paper without smudging the image that I’m trying to print.” (3) Upon leaving his impression, he sifted powdered pigments over the coated paper, capturing color across the printed area. Once the image was set, he sprayed a fixative over the surface, which could also have the effect of intensifying the color. Later he added embellishments, such as the American flag, employing printing techniques such as silkscreen and lithography. Because of the unpredictable nature of the printing process, he printed his body first, adding the silkscreened elements later, once he had determined where the additions would work in relation to the corporeal imagery. By paying close attention to the textures created by certain fabrics, he was able to achieve a high degree of detail in the final print. If he wanted a lighter impression, he would roll his coated body against paper hung on the wall.<br><br>[image5]<br><br>This printing technique is not without precedent in art history. One might recall Robert Rauschenberg and Susan Weil’s experimental photograms with architectural blueprint paper from the 1950s, Yves Klein’s <i>Anthropometries</i> from the early 1960s, and Jasper Johns’s hand and face prints, also from the early 1960s. It is Johns, however, whose technique most closely relates to Hammons’s; he similarly coated his skin with baby oil before making impressions of his body on mechanical drafting paper. Johns’s visages, which seemed imprisoned beneath the paper, were revealed when he rubbed them with strokes of charcoal. (Moreover, it seems germane that nearly a decade earlier Johns also famously interrogated the American flag, recreating it with encaustic and torn fragments of newspaper.)<br><br>[image2]<br><br>In contrast, however, to these noted precedents, Hammons’s work is distinctive in its incorporation of highly charged political subject matter that throws into question the relationship between being an African American and an American citizen—a dissonant reality that was in the process of being intensely challenged during the time that the body prints were made. Hammons has stated: “I feel that my art relates to my total environment—my being a black, political, and social human being. Although I am involved with communicating with others, I believe that my art itself is really my statement. For me it has to be.” (4)<br><br>[image6]<br>[image7]<br><br>In <i>Boy with Flag</i> (1968), one of his earliest body prints, Hammons’s figure is visible on the right side of the paper in profile, his chest pressing up against a section of the American flag that vertically dominates the left side of the composition. In works such as this one, Hammons uses the flag as a structuring device; its proximity delineates the body and its surrounding space. Hammons envisions an uneasy relationship between the two: The flag becomes an object the body must push against and resist, lest it subsume the African American subject. We see this tension perhaps most clearly in the work <i>Black First, American Second</i> (1970). For this print Hammons used black illustration board, rendering the background dark and murky. Twinned impressions of the artist’s body—again in profile with one higher than the other—are shown wrapped in the undulating form of the flag, as if they are hugging it for safety, in what one perceives as an ironic gesture. Yet the two bodies tightly compressed by the flag create an awkward spatial composition, further suggesting that the flag might also be smothering and constricting the figures. In the body prints, the American flag pressurizes the human form, as if it is the agent of disfiguration and distortion, and even a metaphor for agony and torture.<br><br>[image4] <br><br>The subject of torture is rendered most explicitly in Hammons’s body print <i>Injustice Case</i> (1970) where we see the artist, again in profile, violently bound to a chair and gagged. The print is superimposed against an actual American flag that looks sullied in comparison to the stark white sheet of paper. Hammons erased the remaining pigment marks from the background to create the clean, crisp image. The portrait recalls the searing courtroom sketch of Bobby Seale, co-founder of the Black Panthers, during the 1969 trial of the Chicago Eight. After being denied the right to counsel of his choosing, as well as the right to defend himself in court, Seale was bound and gagged in the courtroom in response to his repeated vocal interruptions. He was later sentenced to prison for four years for contempt of court. Due to the unconstitutionality of the proceedings, however, Seale’s sentence was eventually overturned. The trial was widely publicized, and the broadly disseminated drawing became a sign of the injustice of the American legal system for African Americans at that time. Hammons’s use of the American flag in this work challenges the purity associated with the flag and its attendant virtues of “liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” conflating it instead with the inequity of actual black experience. Likewise, the translucent quality of the print, which resembles a photographic negative, conjures the latent absence of political rights, while the form serves as a material trace of Hammons’s own bodily presence.<br><br>[image3]<br><br>Hammons throws the iconic nature of the American flag into question in his body prints, in a patent unraveling of the patriotic symbol—a deconstruction facilitated by the presence of his own black, male body, which he incisively uses as an agent of political indictment. In the ironic <i>America the Beautiful</i> (1968), America is anything but beautiful. Rather, Hammons portrays it as an unsettling yet enigmatic presence to behold—a signifier of the American grotesque. To make this frontal impression, Hammons needed to print each side of his face, so that the two profiles could merge into a single, distorted visage with obliterated eyes. The American flag draped over Hammons’s head, in a pose evocative of the religious cloak (or shroud) of the Virgin Mary, augments the haunting quality of the image. In this print, we see, perhaps, an apotheosis of the “agonized look” Hammons so revered in White’s work. The black figure, here, becomes a ghostly body (again both absent and present): a harbinger for American hypocrisy that at once represents the disenfranchisement, discrimination, and prejudice for an African American body politic. <br><br>By the mid 1970s Hammons had moved on from the body prints, and in 1974, he resettled in New York, where he has made his home ever since. His move to New York coincided with the end of the body prints, and henceforward his work became less graphic and, in general, less overtly political. He would later continue experimental printing techniques in his basketball drawings, bouncing a dirty basketball over a large sheet of paper on the floor to create a hazy, abstract pattern. Furthermore, his interest in rethinking stereotypes and racial identity persisted in his seminal works <i>U.N.I.A. Flag</i> (1990), and <i>African-American Flag</i> (1990), a clever amalgamation of the stars and stripes with Marcus Garvey’s nationalist palette of red, black, and green—a new insignia (with all of its latent irony) for an African American nation.<br><br><br><i>Apsara DiQuinzio is curator of modern and contemporary art and Phyllis C.

Artists expose, in one way or another, the subjective processes of institutions that engage with art. Of the many artworks by David Hammons that could be considered examples of institutional critique, he specifically plays with the idea of unveiling and veiling in two series: the <i>Untitled (Kool-Aid drawing)</i> series (2003 - 2007) and the <i>Untitled</i> series (2009 - 2015). <br><br>Hammons uses Kool-Aid powder to create the colorful abstract Kool-Aid drawings, which resemble watercolor paintings and sometimes include Japanese text written in pencil. The use of Kool-Aid powder by Hammons references both the clichéd connection between the popular soda and African American culture, and the phrase “drinking the Kool-Aid,” derived from the Jonestown deaths. (1)  Besides these more political associations, it might also relate to popular tutorials on different and low cost ways for children to paint with Kool-Aid. Unfortunately, Hammons doesn’t provide information on his inspiration, the way he made the paintings, or English translations of the Japanese writings. It is also clear that the works aren’t drawings, but paintings. Like much of Hammons’s work, the closer you look, and search, the more questions you will find.<br><br>Hammons clearly made a conscious decision to limit the accessibility of the Kool-Aid series in the context of exhibitions. For example, one of the ‘drawings’ was exhibited in <i>Printin’</i>, a group show at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 2012. The description of <i>Untitled (Kool-Aid drawing)</i> (2003) states that the work contains “mixed mediums on paper, terry cloth, and silk,” (2)  but for the most part, the audience was only able to see the white silk. During the day, the work was covered by what has been described as a curtain or veil. A few times a week a member of MoMA’s staff would “lift the veil” for visitors who had made an appointment and came in through a separate entrance. (3)  By adding these metaphorical hoops to jump through, Hammons forced the audience to move their schedule around in order to see the work, and hence, hopefully spend more time than they normally would with a single work in an exhibition. <br><br>[image1]<br><br>The decision to veil the work also gives the painting an element of exclusivity. On the one hand the access to the work was limited to those who did—and could—take the time to come and see the work when it was revealed once a week. On the other hand, the covering up of the painting could be interpreted as an act of preservation, a way to not expose it to light, so the colors would stay intact—a treatment only the most precious, delicate objects receive. Other paintings in the series were not exhibited the same way, indicating that the veiling of the work was not out of necessity, but a choice by Hammons. At James Cohan Gallery only a few months later, another <i>Untitled (Kool Aid drawing)</i> (2004) hung on the wall next to other artworks, with a silk veil draped on the corner of the frame but not covering the work. (4)<br><br>[image2]<br><br>The <i>Untitled</i> series, first exhibited at L&M Arts in 2011, also engages with the idea of “veiling.” The show again consisted of large, colorful, abstract paintings, but this time, instead of accompanied by a white silk veil, they were permanently covered with materials from the streets that many would consider trash, such as plastic, towels, paper, and garbage bags. The materials were ripped apart and draped—sometimes in layers—over the paintings. The viewer might attempt to find parts of the acrylic paintings hidden underneath, or might instead look at the beauty of the entire object. The act of veiling the frame and making its content almost invisible steers the focus away from the painting, and towards the canvas as an object. Traditionally, a painting hangs in a white—and supposedly neutral—space so that the viewers’ attention can be on the aesthetic content. Here, Hammons shifts that focus. <br><br>“White walls are so difficult because everything is out of context. They don’t give me any information. It’s not the way my culture perceives the world. We would never build a shape like that or rooms that way. To us that’s for mad people, you get put in them in the hospital. There’s no other place that I’d seen that kind of room until I came into the art world.” (5)<br><br>Because of Hammons’ rejection of the white cube, it is important to include the gallery in this analysis. L&M Arts is a high-end gallery, located on New York’s Upper East Side, an elite part of the city. Hammons is very particular about the places he exhibits in, and in his first show at L&M Gallery—a collaboration between Hammons and his wife Chie Hammons—he approached the gallery, and not the other way around. (6) Both of Hammons’ exhibitions at L&M Gallery have been described as institutional critique, so the choice by Hammons to exhibit these particular works in that space, with its tony location and elite audience, is definitely not a coincidence.<br><br>[image3]<br><br>A year after the L&M show, Hammons made <i>Dirty Money</i> (2012), the only titled piece within the series. Here, the entire canvas is covered by a tarp, and only a small rip at the top of the frame exposes the presence of a painting underneath. Why Hammons chose to give only this work a title is unclear, but the title emphasizes his critique of the white cube, as well as the capitalist art market and its elite players. <br><br><br><i>Lisa Heinis is pursuing her Ph.D in Art History from the Vrije Universiteit in Brussels and is currently a Visiting Student Scholar at UC Berkeley.

The perfect place to see a work of art in total darkness. Darby English begins his influential book <i>How to See a Work of Art in Total Darkness</i>, which critiques race determinacy in the interpretation of artworks by people of color, by conjuring up this setting:  David Hammons’s installation of <i>Concerto in Black and Blue</i> in 2002 at Ace Gallery on Hudson Street, the largest private contemporary art gallery in Manhattan. This was the artist’s first exhibition in nearly ten years, after a Duchampian interlude of apparent withdrawal from the commercial art world. <br><br>At the door of the gallery, visitors were provided with miniature, pressure-activated flashlights emitting narrow beams of blue light. Thus equipped, they entered 25 thousand square feet of darkness with nothing more than these light beams and the silhouettes of those who entered the space before them to guide their way. Clumping together and drifting apart, these explorers created a lightshow of shifting blue dots, partially illuminating themselves and each other, casting strange shadows. They shuffled and bumped along. Most whispered, as if the near absence of light also called for the near absence of sound. A misstep, or moment of distress, caused a sudden uptick in the decibel level. Sounds echoed, accentuating the vast emptiness of the gallery.<br><br>[image1] <br><br>Some searched for the show’s content (not realizing they were the show’s content). Others, more familiar with canons of contemporary art, sought the reassurance of historical precedent. The blue light may have called to mind Yves Klein’s patented International Klein Blue, a color signifying vast, open space, while the lack of objects may have recalled <i>The Void</i>,  Klein’s famous 1958 exhibition for which he completely emptied Galerie Clert in Paris. The scene may also have summoned up Light and Space movement initiatives of the 1960s, such as James Turrell’s high-intensity projections onto the walls and corners of empty rooms. Contra Klein’s <i>The Void</i>, Hammons’s <i>Concerto in Black and Blue</i> filled the gallery’s white emptiness with blackness. It inverted the logic of Turrell’s sublime environments; darkness, not colored light, immersed the viewer. <br><br>Inevitably, under the circumstances orchestrated by Hammons, darkness (and to a lesser extent, light) assumed metaphorical significance. These are capacious metaphors, yet, as Darby English rightly points out, the critical responses to Hammons’s piece fixated almost exclusively on racial identity (for better or for worse).<br><br>In English’s estimation, Geoffrey Jacques is one of the most reprehensible of the critics. His review for the web publication <i>A Gathering of Tribes</i> concludes, “Black and blue are highly charged colors in the cosmology of African American culture and historical experience. Night’s blackness holds a unique suggestion of terror in black American history. One is also reminded that the ancestors of many families escaped slavery under the cover of darkness, in the blue-black night. There is a sense in which the entire history of Africans in North America can be told through reference to these two colors [black and blue].” (1)  Jan Avgikos, writing for <i>Artforum</i>, confirms “all the ‘black and blue’ of [Hammons’s] Concerto installation refers to African American culture.” (2) To which, English provocatively rejoins, “But if it does, what other than racism can secure these identifications?” (3) Whether or not critics and scholars associate “black and blue” with racial trauma, or with broader histories African American culture (including such art forms as Jazz and Blues), this question remains pertinent. (4)<br><br>Why didn’t the effect of colorblindness created by Ace Gallery’s darkened environment provoke a fuller range of responses to <i>Concerto in Black and Blue</i>? Imagine if the blackout conditions, rather than naturalizing African American culture as key, had instead prevented viewers from seeing racial identity as the dominant theme? <br><br>There are, after all, many equally compelling interpretative options. Points of reference can be found in histories of conceptual art, relational aesthetics, installation, institutional critique, performance, and contemporary music, among other contexts. One could begin with the title, placing emphasis on the first word. A concerto is a large-scale work composed for a solo instrument or instruments accompanied by and orchestra. We could think of the darkness itself as the soloist’s instrument and the blue flashlights as those of the orchestra. Hammons (à la John Cage) sets the parameters: the composition consists of anything that occurs within the designated space and time frame. <br><br>What alternative symbolic meanings might <i>Concerto in Black and Blue</i> generate if we reject the racialized default and restore to darkness a broader spectrum of associations: impenetrability, obscurity, despair, mourning. Keep in mind that this exhibition opened not far from Ground Zero only months after the September 11 attacks in a city still reeling from collective trauma. For Kenneth Baker, and doubtless others, the visitors staggering forward equipped with lights that failed to fully illuminate “honored the sadness of everyone who finds the present moment of American life an especially dark passage.” (5)<br><br>We might then consider the forms of sensibility and sociability the piece proposes. Hammons, by compromising sight, heightens other senses. Visitors must navigate, interdependently, as much by touch and hearing.  Indeed, a concerto is an aural experience, not a visual one. In a society where seeing and understanding are synonyms, <i>Concerto in Black and Blue</i> prompts reflection on the limitations of sight-reliance and alternatives to it. How do we see/understand a social environment in which our visual conditioning (the socially constituted archive of visual codes and cues) is rendered more or less useless? What catch phrases would appear in the critical literature surrounding <i>Concerto in Black and Blue</i> if sensory perception (not African American history and experience) were acknowledged as a primary line of artistic investigation? <br><br>Approaching <i>Concerto in Black and Blue</i> colorblind reveals meanings obscured by the recourse to race as an overarching explanatory framework. Yet the racial metanarratives generated by Hammons’s piece, and its critical reception, also undeniably take part in how the work makes meaning. It is imperative to think critically about the impossibility of eliminating race from the interpretive equation. Because we are not colorblind. Hammons taunts (and haunts) us with this paradox.<br><br><br><i>Tirza True Latimer publishes work from a queer feminist perspective on a range of topics in the fields of visual culture, sexual culture, and criticism.

Classes had no syllabi and did not provide technological instruction, preferring ambiguously titled classes such as Fried\'s own “Physical Education for Performance,” “Real Estate,” “Auto Mechanics,” and “Drugs 101.” Classes were taught by invited artists such as Valie Export, Doug Hall, <a href=\"/gallery/julia-heyward-conscious-knocks-unconscious-2015\">Julia Heyward</a>, Vito Acconci, Linda Montano, and Tom Marioni.<br><br>Fried returns to SFAI to discuss the work on view in <i>Derelicts</i>, as well as the impact his teaching experiences had upon the formulation of his artworks.<br><br>This talk is free.

The artist said: “people in Dakar do not go to exhibitions. They think that the Dak’Art is for white people. . . . At least, with the Sheep Raffle, I’ll give them something that they can relate to.” (1)  To be clear, Hammons was not a participant in the main Dak’Art exhibition, a showcase for contemporary African artists. (2) Instead, <i>Dak’Art 2004 Sheep Raffle</i> was an American “intervention,” one of three commissioned for <i>3x3: Three Artists/Three Projects</i>, an admired contribution to the inaugural Dak’Art Off and International Representations program. (3)<br><br>For <i>3x3</i>, co-curators Salah Hassan and Cheryl Finley invited three U.S.-based artists—Hammons, interdisciplinary artist Pamela Z, and the Cuban-born installation artist Magdalena Campos-Pons—to make site-specific conceptual and performance-based work beyond the “white cube” environment of the official Dak’Art exhibition venues. (4) This curatorial focus on Dakar’s historical cityscape followed Hassan’s published critique of the fifth Dak’Art Biennale that “site specific works were totally absent or poorly conceived.” (5)<br><br>[image3]<br><br>While Campos-Pons and Pamela Z used existing buildings laden with historical memory as their points of departure, Hammons took a slightly different approach to site-specificity, developing his project around a distinct set of actions. (6) He created the opportunity for the Senegalese people to acquire something of great monetary and cultural value. Every day at 4pm from May 6 to May 11, crowds cheered for the two lucky winners who were each presented with a live sheep amid music, singing, and dancing. (7) Apparently, the precise location for the raffle was not determined until after much of the advertising had been printed. Billboards in French indicated that the raffle’s address was “to be announced,” while others in Wolof read: “We will let you know.” (8) Eventually, the project was staged at the busy city intersection of Avenue Bourguiba and the Voie du Nord, associated with open-air markets where sheep are traditionally bought and sold for the annual Islamic holiday of Eid-al-Adha (Festival of the Sacrifice). (9)<br><br>[image4]<br><br>The look of the paper lottery ticket, itself no bigger than a Senegalese banknote, was enlarged and incorporated into the design for <i>Sheep Raffle</i>’s posted billboards. Egyptian-born artist Ramez Elias designed both ticket and billboard, each of which proffers pictorial and textual information in Wolof, French, and English. “<i>Sheep Raffle</i>” and “David Hammons” appear in bold, sans serif font, in white and yellow hues respectively. The phrase “Tombola de Moutons” appears in all caps, its red splatter font chosen no doubt for its resemblance to animal blood. The words tumble across a striking centralized image: a black and white photograph of a young man holding four lambs, taken by Senegalese artist Boubacar Touré Mandémory in collaboration with Hammons. The shepherd and the young, gangly beasts comprise a towering, pyramidal form that almost blocks out the background action—more livestock at a distant watering hole. (10) With his slightly furrowed brow, the youth bears the serious mien of a Spaghetti Western gunslinger. The association is unavoidable, especially as Mandémory has claimed the Italian genre as one of his earliest influences. (11)<br><br>[image5]<br><br>These collateral objects of <i>Sheep Raffle</i> shared visual affinities with Italian neorealist and cinema of the 1940s and the movements it subsequently inspired in Africa. Across the continent, directors made films about pre-colonial histories, traditional allegories, morality tales, and the socio-political narratives of emerging, independent nations at mid-century. With a desire to produce relevant and accessible art for their audiences in their home countries, directors from Italy and from African nations incorporated cultural symbols and hired local people as actors and crew members in their features. The American-born Hammons takes up such strategies in <i>Sheep Raffle</i>. He sought to make the most of Dakar as a location, incorporating the ritual and rhythms of commerce and exchange in the outdoor markets he saw during his visits. <br><br>The dramatis personae of <i>Sheep Raffle</i> were local people, not unlike the non-professional casts of canonical neorealist films. What is different is <i>Sheep Raffle</i>’s tone and takeaway. While Vittorio De <i>Sica’s Sciusiá</i> (1946) and <i>Ladri di Biciclette</i> (1948), and Ousmane Sembene’s <i>Borom Sarret</i> (1963) present pitiable protagonists in dire circumstances, <i>Sheep Raffle</i> is optimistic and celebratory. By orchestrating a lively six-day event featuring entertainment and offering prizes, Hammons conceived experiences of pleasure for Dakarois. Photo documentation of <i>Sheep Raffle</i> indicates a festival-like atmosphere: a cheery red and yellow palette dominates, (12) and many of the assembled wear brightly colored shawls, headscarves, and boubou robes. (13)<br><br>[image2]<br><br><i>Sheep Raffle</i> seems to elude single descriptions. Was it social practice? Was it a street performance? Was it a critique of the Western art industry? Like many community-oriented projects, <i>Sheep Raffle</i> was utterly dependent on numerous creative collaborations. In their publication <i>Diaspora,Memory,Place</i>, Hassan and Finley describe how Hammons enlisted the help of local art students, DJs, designers, and businesses to advertise the event and distribute free tickets throughout the city. (14) The artist worked with popular Senegalese hip-hop artists to create his catchy radio advertisements in French and Wolof. Hammons also garnered sponsorship from Maggi, the popular food seasoning company known for its bouillon stock cubes that have become a staple ingredient of Senegalese cuisine. This collaboration proved to be an effective strategy for ensuring a successful raffle. By tapping into the company’s staff and advertising expertise, Hammons was able to reach a broad range of local audiences in print, on the radio, and through loudspeaker announcements delivered from Maggi trucks moving through Dakar’s neighborhoods. Company employees also handled the functional aspects of the raffle itself, including procuring the live sheep and providing the truck and platform for the entertainers who were similarly decked out in Maggi branded t-shirts and hats.   <br><br><i>Sheep Raffle</i> is akin to the artist’s other outdoor street performances such as <i>Bliz-aard Ball Sale</i> (1983), <i>Higher Goals</i> (1986), and <i>Phat Free</i> (1995/99). Yet unlike his role in these works, Hammons is not the central performer in <i>Sheep Raffle</i>. He is not the raffle emcee nor does he appear in official documentation of the piece. Filmmaker and cultural critic Manthia Diawara recalls catching glimpses of the artist sitting on top of a platform, “surveying the performance” and occasionally descending to take video on a small camera. (15) Hammons’s conspicuous absence might suggest an equally strong connection to works such as <i>Concerto in Black and Blue</i> (2002) that focus on the interaction between participants rather than the performance of the individual artist. As Laurie Ann Farrell suggests, the “genius of Hammons’s project lies in his appropriation of the sheep raffle as a compelling strategy to further his engagement with ‘the idea of the performative.’” (16)  <br><br><i>Sheep Raffle</i>, created for a well-funded art exhibition, was presented as a contrast to biennials, auctions, and gallery openings—major events of the capitalist art industry. In some of these settings, artworks are commodities, fungible items that are bought and sold. Money changes hands off-stage and away from the camera for <i>Dak’Art 2004 Sheep Raffle</i>. Were the workers—Maggi employees, art students, and DJs—compensated? Even if Hammons’s collaborators volunteered their services, the livestock was likely purchased through the <i>3x3</i> exhibition budget and then distributed according to the laws of chance. <br><br><i>Sheep Raffle</i> not only attracted local raffle-goers and tourists, but also artists and art world cognoscenti eager to see Hammons’s latest intervention and was said to be the most well-attended artwork in Dak’Art 2004. Yet not all audiences embraced the piece. As Diawara reports, “Some people thought that it was arrogant on the part of a Black American to come to Africa and make fun of Africans as art.” (17) For this reason, some African artists refused to view the work, offering that only Hammons could get away with such a stunt because of his status in the art world. <br><br>[image1]<br><br>And, how are we to understand Hammons’s collaboration with Maggi, especially in light of the 2004 Biennale’s theme, “Contemporary African Art to the Test of Globalization: Problems, Challenges and Prospects”? Maggi, a Nestlé subsidiary, is not a neutral player in the global market economy. (18) While the brand has been adopted as part of local culture and cuisine in more than sixty countries as a meat substitute, its products continue to be criticized for damaging health and local traditions because of their high levels of sodium, MSG, and hydrogenated oils. (19) Was Hammons deliberately pointing to this multinational food corporation as a symbol of Western hegemony? Perhaps the company’s name and its oblique associations with magic and magi, the traveling gift-bearing wise men, appealed to the trickster artist’s notorious love of linguistic word play. (20)<br><br>Just as Maggi calls forth various meanings, “sheep” is a loaded term with consequential associations. In many cultures, sheep are seen as strong animals; the male ram, in particular, is a paragon demonstrating virility and resolve. Hammons’s evocation of sheep also resonates with the cautionary words of Nigerian artist and cultural critic Olu Oguibe, who suggested that contemporary African artists are “tacitly forbidden to appear critical” of the Dak’Art Biennales or else are “cast as black sheep fit for slaughter.” (21) If we extend the idiomatic conveyance of disreputability and outsider status to any maverick artist hailing from any place, <i>Sheep Raffle</i> ties into Hammons’s own publicly performed contrariness and articulated opposition to the capitalist art market. Time and time again, Hammons proclaims that he is no damn sheep that hews to the prescribed order. (22) Is <i>Sheep Raffle</i> yet another display of Hammons’s impatience and open disdain for the capitalist art market with the raffle itself operating as a cynical allegory for the few winners and hordes of losers within the art world? (23) Does <i>Sheep Raffle</i> replicate the Western art market theatrics—the ebb and flow pronouncements of artistic success and failure, the subjective judgments of shepherd tastemakers and moneyed institutions, which herd docile creatives and peddle self-interested narratives to unquestioning audiences?<br><br>Possibly. But nevertheless, a resolutely generous spirit runs through <i>Sheep Raffle</i> that defeats pessimism. In Senegal and in many other places, sheep are prized and revered animals. They are kept and bred to be sold for profit. Mutton meat is eaten, shared with family and neighbors, and/or donated to the impoverished, acts proscribed during the Eid-al-Adha holidays. In light of these traditions, we might see <i>Sheep Raffle</i> through the lens of Lewis Hyde’s classic treatise <i>The Gift</i> (1983), in which the value of the art practice resides in its enduring and capacious generosity. (24) Yet <i>Sheep Raffle</i> also demands consideration of sacrifice—the literal acts of worship and appeasement (bloody and bloodless) —inserted into the context of contemporary art making, a messy and irresolvable notion with which we must contend.<br><br><br><i>Jacqueline Francis is an art historian, curator, and writer.

Because it’s so hard to live in this city.

Hammons pointedly created sculptural objects, many of which fused modernism’s privileging of form with a contemporary emphasis on the social meanings of materials. He utilized detritus such as hair, chicken bones, bottle caps, and wine bottles as source material for these works. By 1986, he had already made a name for himself as an artist invested in sculpting, printing, and arranging the pains and pleasures of black life without the promise of figurative, representational, or illustrative explanation.

These blinds are no longer pristine white; they have rusted into hues of deep brown, spotted with dark stains. This singular object made of many is then affixed onto a wood plane. The two wings form seven sensuous curves that ripple out from small to large in a figure-8 shape, an infinity sign that echoes out of its center into a circumscription of waves. It is a body, doubling over seven times, bending to form itself ad infinitum.<br><br>As window dressings, blinds perform a dual function: they conceal and reveal what is on both sides of the window, rendering into sight the external world and its attendant interior. In Hammons’s hands, these blinds no longer function. Indeed, this sculpture is blind leading to blind in which the materiality of the object itself makes possible the condition of not seeing. Public and private are thrown into crisis as the blinds mediate how to see and be seen through the window frame. Anne Friedberg’s elaboration of the history of the window as a constitutive foundation of seeing and perspective in the history of art is of particular relevance: <br><br><i>The window is an opening, an aperture for light and ventilation. It opens, it closes; it separates the spaces of here and there, inside and outside, in front of and behind. The window opens onto a three-dimensional world beyond: it is a membrane where surface meets depth, where transparency meets its barriers. The window is also a frame, a proscenium: its edges hold a view in place.</i> (4)<br><br>Moving beyond the window’s delineation of inside and outside, Hammons suggests we turn to its covering as a mediator of sight between these two locations. The doubleness of the work is presented at the levels of form and meaning: blind as material and blind as a state of awareness. This doubleness refocuses our attention toward the actuality of sight itself, the close intimacy between seeing and knowing one’s reality. If, as the saying goes, there are none so blind as those who will not see, then <i>Blind Reality</i> asks us to consider what is left unseen, those modes of living left unattended to and in the margins of the visible.<br><br>For Hammons, these practices are often activated in the streets. Hammons is quick to say that he’d rather “play with the street audience” because “they’re already at that place that [he’s] trying to get to.” (5) This location that is not singular—the streets—always leads to a deferred point of arrival for Hammons. The streets traffic knowledge and meanings that exist outdoors and away from the window pane that frames what one sees from the comfort of the indoors. Hammons prefers to be outside, inhabiting modes of living that are relatively unseen if one is blind to their existence. This is yet another twist on what Glenn Ligon has so brilliantly called Hammons’s “movement toward placelessness” — an insistence that “not being from here” is a “deep critique of American society.” (6) If Hammons is not from here, then perhaps he is from there: that place seen in the distance, through the blinds and outside of the window’s frame. Over <i>there</i>, where the outside forms the inside, exterior forms the interior. <i>Blind Reality</i> is that möbius strip where blind makes blind. There, seeing is offered as a way of knowing and those unseen may in fact open on to ways of knowing rendered partially visible, if at all.<br><br>This blind reality—a there constituted by here, an inside made up of its outside—might best be felt in the closing stanza of Ben Okri’s poem “An Open Way,” written especially for Hammons’s 2016 show <i>Give Me A Moment</i>:<br><br>The infinity <br>Of an always<br>Open way<br>Of seeing.<br><br><br><i>Sampada Aranke is an Assistant Professor in the History and Theory of Contemporary Art at the San Francisco Art Institute.

First called <i>Coke Cane</i> as a commentary on what Amei Wallach, in a 1991 <i>Los Angeles Times</i> article, called the “blind waste and bottomless outrage of the drug epidemic,” this piece was later retitled <i>Blind Reality</i>, a move that Wallach has notably deemed “the improvisational mode that is at the heart of the art.” There is a story to be told between these two blind realities. The peculiar and seemingly unrelated nominal inheritance, the disparity between material choices, and the uneven uptake of the 1989 work as compared to the 1986 work all offer starting points for discussion. <br><br>(3) <i>Blind Reality</i> (1986) must also be understood in the time of its making, in which a reactionary politics of “color blindness” was emerging as a neoconservative response to the radical premises and promises of 1960s and 70s social movements. We can assume that Hammons was well aware of then-Attorney General Edwin Meese’s infamous 1985 speech in which he insisted that “counting by race is a form of racism.” This speech, now recollected as a hallmark in the architecture of colorblindness, manufactured as a so-called remedy to racism and deceptively aimed at dismantling affirmative action and other legal protections that came out of the Civil Rights era. We can extend his claim into a broader insistence that to see race is to somehow perpetuate the structures of white supremacy and racism. Meese insists that sight is the operative logic of racism, and not, for example, the socio-economic, legal, and affective structures that enable the logic of anti-black violence specifically and racism more broadly. Unbeknownst to Meese, his conclusion misleads but the means to his analysis remains true—racism does, in fact, encourage “us to stereotype” and invite “us to look upon people as possessors of certain characteristics.” Colorblindness, then, serves to not only reproduce the structures of racism, but to do so in the practice of seeing itself—a form of policing that takes place first and foremost at the level of sight.

I think it’s important to be laughed at.” (1) Although revealing, I take exception with the last word in the artist’s statement. Even though his work is clever, witty, and oftentimes humorous enough to generate an apologetic guffaw, I never laugh <i>at</i> Hammons. To the contrary, I always laugh <i>because</i> of him. The artist’s creations not only amuse, they provoke, and upon learning the title, my perception, reception, and reading of the work are enhanced. Moreover with each object, installation, or performance, I am encouraged to explore, to research, and to discover the messages delivered by the trickster, the shaman, the Br’er David—as the scholar Robert Storr refers to him. (2)<br><br>[image2]<br><br>Such is the case with <i>Putting on Sunday Manners</i>, 1990. I was immediately attracted to its minimalist form and composition of materials—an inner tube, chair back, flipper, and tennis ball. This arresting sculpture intrigues on its own accord, but after reading the title and contemplating the pun, a raised eyebrow and a nod of the head signify an initial understanding of its meaning. These gestures also indicate one’s willingness to be drawn into Hammons’s magical world of objects and their double entendres. My induction into this realm was enabled by a visit to SFMOMA’s offsite storage facility, where I experienced <i>Putting on Sunday Manners</i> in an intimate setting. Once there, I examined the piece up close. I saw the work in its various postures: disassembled, assembled, and installed at two different heights. In fact it was the latter—these varying positions of placement on the wall—that sparked my alternating visual interpretations of the artwork. <br><br>[image1]<br><br><i>Putting on Sunday Manners</i> is a compound sculpture that can be read as either a mask or a codpiece with a protrusion evocative of a nose combined with a mouth or a penis with a vulva. It is reminiscent of the abstracted beauty found in many West African tribal cultural expressions, like the Ngil ceremonial masks of the Fang people of Gabon. Or the protrusion is suggestive of a male phallus clad in a prophylactic; the object is predominantly made from a rubber inner tube. But most significantly, another dimension to the work is its hybridity—the object lives in between the “street” and the “white cube.” Typical of Hammons’s oeuvre and like an excessively oiled and agile wrestler, it is difficult to pin down. One must mentally tussle with it, turn it over, attempt to grab onto some part in order to understand it. This method in which the object’s title and form combine to perform a textual and visual pun generative of multiple meanings is a signature feature of Hammons’s productions. (3) This feature speaks to my overarching attraction to Hammons’s body of work, particularly <i>Putting on Sunday Manners</i>. The title induces thought, contemplation, and dissection of a phrase that can be interpreted as donning one’s Sunday best to attend church or the Sunday-go-to-meeting ritual. However, upon examination of each word in the title, the many layers of <i>Putting on Sunday Manners</i> get peeled back. <br><br>When related to the observable characteristics of a person, “manner” is an adherence to the customary rules of behavior and the strict standards of society, as well as according to the Oxford English Dictionary, “A person\'s social [behavior] or habits, judged according to the degree of politeness or the degree of conformity to accepted standards of [behavior] or propriety.” (4) Arguably, Hammons’s mercurial and elusive art world antics contradict conformity to accepted standards. In fact, his disregard for working within the confines of the “white cube” art establishment is a manner that almost every critical survey cites when commenting on his oeuvre:<br><br>\"Despite twenty years of activity, David Hammons has been until very recently a virtual stranger to the museum world, and remains indifferent to its house rules. The White Cube holds no magic for him. What is to some the laboratory of art is to Hammons an arbitrary and ominously clinical environment, inhospitable to the lived forms he collects and transfigures. If it signifies anything, it is the challenge to find whatever manifestation of ordinary human vitality that has survived or can survive its antiseptic ambiance. \" (5)<br><br>The excerpt above alludes to Hammons’s assemblage compositions as well as his flat, framed, two-dimensional body prints, which he moved on from in the mid 1970s in order to explore performance and sculptural work. He began to utilize “lived forms” affiliated with an urban African American vernacular, such as hair from black barbershop floors, chicken bones, and Thunderbird liquor bottles. This move further delineates the artist’s rejection of the status quo found in the art academy as elucidated in his own words: “There are still so many cracks. I’ve got it figured out. They [the art world] don’t know, can’t figure out what I’m doing because they don’t have anything to measure it with.” (6)<br><br>With <i>Putting on Sunday Manners</i>, Hammons once again dictates which manner to adopt. The piece marks a shift from tools the artist specifically associated with black culture to more abstracted materials, such as an inner tube, chair back, flipper, and tennis ball. The constellation of elements in <i>Putting on Sunday Manners</i> combines to create an object aligned with an African American identity, even if not as blatant as before. In other words and to be blunt, there is no mistaking that the sculpture is evocative of a big black penis—a stereotype affiliated with African American men. Although more abstract than in previous configurations, the work still incorporates used and discarded found objects. For instance, the tennis ball isn’t the typical pristine, fresh out-of-the-can yellow. It is a gray-brown color seemingly caked with mud. The flipper and the chair back are also worn, no longer having the sheen characteristic of new material. And the inner tube is visibly soiled with dirt, perhaps a byproduct of its past life. <br><br>If we examine the words <i>putting on</i> as in applying a particular behavior, then <i>Putting on Sunday Manners</i> can be perceived as Hammons donning the cloak of the trickster: the artist, working outside the rules of the mainstream art world, who decides to present aspects of the black American experience—in a manner not typically shown—via the juxtaposition of ordinary materials in creative ways. Hammons’s prankster-like methods embody “…an innately but nevertheless fully self-conscious spirit of rebellion.” (7) Like the shaman that he is, Hammons’s sculptures conjure multiple meanings and feelings that force the organizing of one’s thoughts, tackling them one at a time in order to understand what one is sensing. Thus in this particular object, Hammons is strapping on a hybridized codpiece with a chair back reminiscent of a superhero’s waistband; all that’s missing are the tights, the cape, and arms outstretched. Additionally, putting on speaks to adopting two diverse entities simultaneously—allowing for an abstracted interpretation of both male and female genitalia. The juxtaposition of the tennis ball and the flipper creates the protrusion, but individually the ball located at the end of the shaft expresses the head of a penis while the flipper creates an opening or vagina. The thick rubber inner tube is a paradox as it sheathes the mechanism that apposes the ball and flipper while concurrently it is cut away to expose the business end of the protrusion. Is this what the artist means by putting on or “putting out for display” one’s Sunday best? <br><br><i>Putting on Sunday Manners</i> is a sculptural, three-dimensional work of art that does more than simply hang on the wall; it interjects itself into space. It commands a presence and makes itself known by virtue of its form and title. Recognized as a codpiece or a mask or something else entirely, <i>Putting on Sunday Manners</i> has also been identified as a portrait, accounting for its contribution as one of the featured artworks in <i>Portraits and Other Likenesses from SFMOMA</i>, an exhibition at the Museum of the African Diaspora. However, is <i>Putting on Sunday Manners</i> a portrait of the artist, or is it the artist’s portrait of black American mannerisms? Does the title assist in getting us closer to making that determination? These are the type of questions that Hammons conjures and compels us to scuffle with while viewing his work. As such, <i>Putting on Sunday Manners</i> is an example of Br’er David performing his “spirit of rebellion” through the creation of an object that prompts many questions, provides few answers, and makes us privy to the manner in which the trickster constantly amuses, entertains, and mentally keeps us on our toes.<br><br><br><i>Veronica Jackson is an exhibition designer and independent curator.

Informed by Ringgold’s legacy as well as the current political climate, <i>Black Light</i> poses questions about how to re-conceptualize cultural representation, engagement, and critique: What spaces for agency are available to black artists today, and by what means have they produced spaces for themselves? What models does history offer artists working now? What role do institutions play? How do communities make themselves visible? Can artists dream the sociopolitical landscape differently, and what forms does this dreaming take?<br><br>The events are anchored by a single, large-scale abstract painting, <i>red dust between</i> (2017), by the Los Angeles-based artist <a href = \'https://www.vielmetter.com/artists/rodney-mcmillian/selected-works.html\' target= \'new\'>Rodney McMillian</a>. Painted on a discarded bed sheet, the work imagines contemporary society—and especially the conditions of black life in America today—as a disorienting and dark fairytale. At the same time, the painting offers glimmers of hope not only in its evocation of sleep, dreaming, and transcendence, but also in its suggestion of the redemptive possibilities of reclaiming and repurposing abandoned materials.<br><br>An accompanying publication gathers new interviews with Dale Brockman Davis, Karon Davis, Rasheedah Phillips, and a conversation between representatives of Black Women Artists for Black Lives Matter.

And not with fluorescent bulbs, but with the older, more-expensive-to-operate kind, the filament type. An act of sabotage, you know. I\'ve already begun to wire the wall.

It is the opening weekend of Prospect.3, New Orleans’ biennial of contemporary art, and Andrea Fraser’s hour-long performance <i>Not just a few of us</I> (2014) at the New Orleans Museum of Art immediately commands an audience that includes curators and critics who have jetted in from New York and Los Angeles. Dressed in a black blazer and pants, Fraser acts out nineteen different roles captured in a recording of a 1993 New Orleans City Council hearing on a proposed ordinance to desegregate Mardi Gras krewes. The ordinance passed unanimously, but the systemic racism revealed behind closed doors is shameful. The heated discussion, which represents only a fraction of the eight-hour hearing, is fueled by discriminatory viewpoints disguised as economic concerns. The argument that Mardi Gras will collapse if krewes are forced to end discrimination, resulting in a huge loss of financial support for the city, is not only spurious but also overlooks the lack of funds diverted to African American communities.<br><br>Perhaps the most distressing realization though is how the topic is as relevant today as it was in 1993. Michael Brown and Eric Garner have been killed by police in the last four months, and racism is at the forefront of American minds. By exposing a new audience to a conversation that helped shape contemporary New Orleans, Fraser sets the tone for a biennial that seeks to engage with the city’s complex recent history and its impact on the present. Historical reenactment is au courant among politically minded artists, but it is not without its shortcomings, which <i>Not just a few of us</i> takes care to avoid. Operating within the histories of theater, performance art, and site-specificity, the mesmerizing work is undoubtedly germane, but can it also be transformative?<br><br>In the past two decades, many artists have turned toward historical reenactment in service of making sense of the present through the past. In the catalogue accompanying the 2005 exhibition <i>Life, Once More: Forms of Reenactment in Contemporary Art</i> at Rotterdam’s Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art, Sven Lütticken draws a lineage from appropriation art to historical reenactment in contemporary art, noting their shared effort to “generate difference from extremely literal repetition . . . pushed to an extreme to show how the de- and re- contextualization of a seemingly unchanged image is able to effect a profound change.”(1) Jeremy Deller’s <i>Battle of Orgreave</i> (2001), a restaging of a violent struggle during a mining strike in Britain, is often cited as an exemplary work in the fledgling genre. However, in her trenchant book on participatory art <i>Artificial Hells</i>, Claire Bishop criticizes the project for reopening a wound rather than healing it.(2) Mark Tribe commissioned actors to perform seminal speeches from the Civil Rights and New Left Movements at their original sites in <i>Port Huron Project</i> (2006-2009), and the endeavor willfully lives on through performance documentation available on a website. While praised by many for reinvigorating the reform spirit of the 1960s and 1970s, academics such as Paige Sarlin and Julia Bryan-Wilson have criticized it as nostalgic and ineffectual.(3) <i>Not just a few of us</i> differs from the two aforementioned examples in its verbatim adherence to a moment in history that has not been canonized (at least outside its immediate locale). Its potency derives not from a visual spectacle or from an appeal to collective memory, but instead from a visceral affect drawn from performance itself; Fraser is informed by her own experience of using her body as a tool to instigate change.<br><br>History has a complicated relationship to the present in capitalist culture, and performance art—and specifically the use of the body—has become the most authentic medium for reproducing the past. <i>Not just a few of us</i> is firmly rooted in a consumerist environment, with one dissenter to the anti-discrimination ordinance claiming that “Mardi Gras generates over 400 million dollars of economic activity” and “we should not kill Mardi Gras.” A city councilwoman then takes the commitment to capitalism a step further by concluding that “If we tamper with legislating socio-economics, we have become a socialistic county and we are founded as a democratic capitalistic society.” This appeal to consumer culture apparent in the script itself is counteracted by the means of expression employed by Fraser.<br><br>The concept of contemporary art, and more specifically performance art, as an antidote to capitalism is well-theorized, and <i>Not just a few of us</i> fits neatly into this trajectory. In his essay <i>The Way of the Shovel: On the Archaeological Imaginary in Art</i>, Dieter Roelstraete laments current culture’s obsession with the New and the Now, but finds redemption in art, which “is there to ‘remember’ when all else urges us to ‘forget’ and simply look forward—primarily to new products and consumerist fantasies—or, worse still, inward.”(4) Performance art arose in defiance of capitalism, working with the one medium that has not yet been commodified: the body.(5) As Jennifer Allen notes, “While a reenactment may depend on historical documents and artifacts… the body remains the vehicle that can carry the past into the present, that can give the past presence.”(6) Erin Hurley and Sara Warner have argued that time-based performing arts have the most affective power of any cultural form, due in part to the bodily and sensorial entanglement inherent in performance.(7) Fraser’s work has always relied on her own physicality as an instrument of transformation, and in <i>Not just a few of us</i>, her ability to embody a host of different characters without a change of actors or even costume reveals a rejection of superficial tropes in favor of a deeper engagement with the content itself. Fraser’s oeuvre is intimately connected to Conceptual art, and much of her work focuses on the primacy of the body over visual spectacle. With <i>Not just a few of us</i>, she continues a conscious shift in her practice and rhetoric over the past few years away from critiquing the art world and misogyny, a reaction to the bastardization of the term “institutional critique.” Instead she uses her spartan style to emphasize the impassioned opinions expressed at the hearing.<br><br>“Where do we come from? What are we? Where are we going?” Curator Franklin Sirmans asks in his introductory text for Prospect.3 (sentences borrowed from the title of an 1898 Gauguin painting). Fraser answers these questions literally, speaking as nineteen individuals—from a white Republican councilwoman to an African American NAACP chapter president—who occupied positions in very recent New Orleans history. Performance documentation is sometimes criticized as a betrayal of the authentic unmediated event, and part of the power of <i>Not just a few of us</i> derives from its existence as part of this biennial at this specific site. Because of Fraser’s proprietary hold on documentation of her work, it is unlikely that an audience outside of the 500 plus attendees of her two performances at Prospect.3(8) will ever see the video recording of this work. Unlike <i>Port Huron Project</i>, which manifests most significantly as a teaching tool through videos and a website, <i>Not just a few of us</i> occupies a unique moment in time and space.<br><br><i>Not just a few of us</i> marks a return to a more theatrical mode of expression for Fraser that is highly effective. Her excellent acting skills and inimitable physical presence remind the audience why theater continues to thrive even in today’s media-saturated culture. Her adroit manipulation of historical documentation by means of her own body has an immediate impact. Far from seeming regressive, the subject matter keeps <i>Not just a few of us</i> relevant. As the Black Lives Matter movement burgeons, the piece reminds us of the systemic racism of our collective past. Fraser’s work has never been deliberately didactic, like that of her contemporaries Mark Tribe or Tania Bruguera, and yet her work is undoubtedly political. Moving her attention from Institutional Critique to a broader condemnation of social ills, Fraser is able to both engage with local history and an international art audience, the formidable goal of many a biennial artist. Outside the context of Prospect.3, however, the lasting impact of the performance remains to be seen, and perhaps that is perfectly fine by Fraser.<br><br>Notes:<br>(1) Sven Lütticken, ed., <i>Life, Once More: Forms of Reenactment in Contemporary Art</i> (Rotterdam: Witte de With, 2005), 59.<br><br>(2) Claire Bishop, <i>Artificial Hells: Participatory Art and the Politics of Spectatorship</i> (London: Verso Books, 2012), 32.<br><br>(3) See Paige Sarlin, “New Left-Wing Melancholy: Mark Tribe’s ‘The Port Huron Project’ and the Politics of Reenactment,” <i>Framework: The Journal of Cinema and Media</i>, Vol. 50, No. 1 & 2 (2009), 139-157; and Julia Bryan Wilson, “Sounding the Fury: Kirsten Forkert and Mark Tribe,” Artforum International, Vol. 45, No. 5 (January 2008), 95.<br><br>(4) Dieter Roelstraete, “The Way of the Shovel: On the Archaeological Imaginary in Art,” <i>e-flux journal</i>, no. 4 (March 2009), at: http://www.e-flux.com/journal/the-way-of-the-shovel-on-the-archeological-imaginary-in-art/<br><br>(5) Ironically, Fraser’s <i>Untitled</i> (2003)—an editioned video of Fraser engaging in a sexual act with a collector for an undisclosed sum of money—is one of the few exceptions.<br><br>(6) Jennifer Allen, “‘Einmal ist keinmal’ Observations on Reenactment” in <i>Life, Once More</i>, 181.<br><br>(7) Erin Hurley and Sara Warner, “Special Section: Affect, Performance, Politics,” <i>Journal of Dramatic Theory and Criticism</i>, Vol. 26, No. 2 (Spring 2012), 99-107.<br><br>(8) The performance was reprised on January 21, 2015.',''),(473,1,'2017-07-14 01:22:46','2017-07-21 01:51:17',NULL,'<i>The Work of the Artist in the Age of Mimetic Reproduction:\r\nAndrea Fraserâ€™s \"Official Welcome\" (2001â€“3)</i>\r\nby Ross Sappenfield',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'the-work-of-the-artist-in-the-age-of-mimetic-reproduction-andrea-frasera-s-official-welcome-2001a-3-by-ross-sappenfield',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',_binary '<i>“In some way or another one can protect oneself from evil spirits by portraying them.” - Erland Nordenskiold and Ruben Pérez Kantule, quoted in Michael Taussig, <u>Mimesis and Alterity: A Practical History of the Senses</i></u><br><br>1. Magic, specifically sympathetic magic (to use J.G. Frazer’s term from <i>The Golden Bough</i>), or mimetic magic (to use Horkheimer and Adorno’s term from <i>Dialectic of Enlightenment</i>) is probably not the obvious category in which most would place Andrea Fraser’s art. When artists are compared to shamans, Joseph Beuys is the more likely subject. But possibly many of Fraser’s works could indeed be described as mimetic magic.<br><br>2. Fraser’s body of work created in the period 1986 through 2001 consists most prominently of performances that enact a critique (or “analysis” to use her preferred term) of the institutions that frame art and artworks. While in that same period she also made works of visual art, organized seminars, and researched corporate art programs, the performance pieces are what she is most known for, and are in number the most prolific form. Fraser’s performance technique, especially dating back to <i>Museum Highlights: A Gallery Talk</i> (1989), uses mimetic appropriation of discourse—specifically of the discourse of the individuals who compose art institutions. These works almost always include: Fraser as performer, a montage of appropriated texts as scripts, parodic impersonation of various participants in the art patronage system (museum officials, docents, patrons, collectors, viewers), and finally, in <i>Kunst muss hängen</i> (Art must hang) (2001) and in <i>Official Welcome</i> (2001–3), parodic impersonation of artists.<br><br>3. In <i>Official Welcome</i>, Fraser begins by stepping up to a podium and delivering a standard version of an artist’s thank-you remarks at an exhibition opening, addressed to the public and to patrons, in this case the founders of the MICA Foundation—which, in fact, did commission the work. As the piece progresses, though, Fraser begins to assume different personalities and voices, alternating between patrons’ hagiographical introductions and artists’ self-congratulatory responses. Along the way the performed voices get more and more histrionic, Fraser ends up stripping naked, and then finally bursts into tears after delivering a weepy closing speech.<br><br>4. The comic, specifically parodic, aspects of Fraser’s work until 2001 are clearly important, especially because, after <i>Official Welcome</i>, she effectively abandoned the parodic mode. There is a clear rift in her body of work after <i>Official Welcome</i>: in that performance, she at long last brings the figure of the artist under the attack of parodic mimesis. Also important is <i>Kunst muss hängen</i>, the performance that immediately preceded <i>Official Welcome</i>, in<br>which Fraser renders verbatim (in German) a drunken rant originally delivered at an opening by the artist Martin Kippenberger. In the works that followed <i>Official Welcome, Exhibition</i> (2002) and <i>Untitled</i> (2003) the figure of the artist and the artist/collector relationship continue to be foregrounded. But the humor is abandoned, or at best becomes so deeply dark that it is at the limit of humor. In <i>Exhibition</i> Fraser literally put the artist—herself—on display, in a video showing her dancing (depicted from front and rear) in a skimpy samba school costume. Next, in <i>Untitled</i>, she enacted the trope of artist-as-prostitute in a literal sense: in a room at the four-star Royalton Hotel in New York, she has a sex with a collector intermediated by her gallery, an act documented in grainy surveillance-camera style. Can <i>Untitled</i> be seen as comic? Possibly, when the silent sex video is taken together with the separate connected work, a short excerpt of the excised audio track for the original video that excludes the collector’s voice. In that recording, Fraser laughingly tells the collector that, when she lost her virginity at age 16, she ruptured an artery and had to be taken away in an ambulance. But there is a clear trajectory up to <i>Official Welcome</i>, and then a break after it. Fraser’s works after <i>Untitled</i> become much more overtly deadpan and serious, ranging from the auto-mimetic analytic discourse of Projection, the political essays of <i>L\'1% C’est Moi</i> (2011) and <i>There’s No Place Like Home</i> (2012), up to and including her recent return to the mimetic mode in the much more somber works <i>Men on the Line</i> (2012) and <i>Not Just a Few of Us</i> (2014). Interestingly, those last two performances use their appropriated texts in a straight, seemingly verbatim approach, unlike <i>Official Welcome’s</i> wild mélange of sources.<br><br>5. Walter Benjamin’s idea that mechanical reproduction destroyed the cultic “aura” of the artwork could ground one understanding of <i>Official Welcome</i>. As Benjamin put it (in one of his many formulations of the concept) in “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (1936), “To pry an object from its shell, to destroy its aura, is the mark of a perception whose ‘sense of the universal equality of things’ has increased to such a degree that it extracts it even from a unique object by means of reproduction.”<br><br>6. Aura is important to <i>Official Welcome</i> because, as noted, in it Fraser turns her focus from the institutional framework of art to that of the social figure of the <u>artist</u>. Or, more precisely, she examines the artist/patron antinomy from both sides. If the aura was destroyed for the <u>work of art</u>, the aura was nonetheless retained by the <u>artist</u>. Art lost its aura; the artist did not. Fraser’s turn to the artist in <i>Official Welcome</i> finally subjects the character of the artist to the same amputation of aura. She does this by reproducing the public dialogue of artist and patron in a brilliant montage, revealing and exploding in excessive amplification the commoditized nature of both halves of that dialectic, in a way that echoes Benjamin on the movie star: “The cult of the movie star, fostered by the money of the film industry, preserves not the unique aura of the person but the ‘spell of the personality,’ the phony spell of the commodity.”<br><br>7. As a return to the comic and the parodic, <i>Official Welcome</i> is Fraser’s best execution of those modes. It is laugh-out-loud funny. It might make sense to discuss the sublime here. For Longinus in <i>On The Sublime</i>, the sublime is whatever produces a specific effect, specifically, <i>ekstasis</i>, which is a loss of the self. Relevant is his brief digression on <u>comic</u> <i>ekstasis</i>, in which the work of art takes us out of ourselves, takes us out of analytical reflection—in the case of the sublime by awing us, in the case of the comic by making us laugh. Another characteristic of humor, though, is that of distantiation. If one accepts the research of psychologists McGraw and Warren in their paper “Benign Violations” (2010), a key aspect of humor being seen as such includes an aspect of perceived harmlessness. Perhaps one could read Fraser’s move away from the comic as a recognition that, while the comic has the potential for <i>ekstasis</i>, it is also inherently distanced, effectively harmless, and therefore perhaps of doubtful political efficacy.<br><br>8. Why does Fraser get naked at the end of <i>Official Welcome</i>? She has joked about her finally joining the ranks of “nudie performance art” in the piece. First there is the stripping down to Gucci lingerie (specified by brand name in the script), the motive of which is clear as in that part of the script she quotes artist Vanessa Beecroft. The next move to full nudity is less obvious but can probably be explained by its proximity in the script to a reference to Karen Finley, whose nude body is a tool and medium in her graphic performances. But another, and maybe more essential part of the move could be read as an attempt to retain a distantiation in the work, to retain the aura. As Theodor Adorno noted in his <i>Aesthetic Theory</i>, to some extent Walter Benjamin celebrated the demise of aura, perhaps to the point of celebrating the demise of art: “Identifying with the aggressor, he all too promptly allied himself with the historical tendency that remands art to the empirical domain of practical ends. As a phenomenon, distance is what in artworks transcends their mere existence; their absolute nearness would be their absolute integration.” <i>Official Welcome</i> is presented as a work of art, and the work of an artist, and specifically as a live performance. Benjamin wrote: “To perceive the aura of an object we look at means to invest it with the ability to look at us in return.” Under this definition, live performance should invest a work with aura particularly effectively, and this effect is heightened when enacted by the simultaneously bold and vulnerable nude performer. In <i>Official Welcome</i>, the artist—despite commoditization, despite being fixed in a social position—after dispelling the aura of the empowered (patrons, artists) by mimetically reproducing their discourse, in fact retains the aura by defiantly looking back at the viewer.',''),(474,1,'2017-07-14 01:40:33','2017-07-21 01:38:16',NULL,'<i>Funny Lady</i>\r\nby Jacqueline Francis',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'funny-lady-by-jacqueline-francis',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',_binary 'Andrea Fraser is funny.<br><br>Over her 25-year career, Andrea Fraser has created performances that veer from the satirical (<i>Museum Highlights</i>, 1989) and parodic (<i>Art Must Hang</i>, 2001) to the notoriously absurd (<i>Little Frank and His Carp</i>, 2001) and absurdly notorious (<i>Untitled</i>, 2003). In an interview from 2012, Fraser rejected the mantle of the entertainer and yet clearly embraced the strategy of comedy.(1) Entertainment is a mere diversion—a looking <i>at</i> that means looking <i>away</i> from some other important things—while comedy demands audience commitment and attention to its form and content. Furthermore, comedy, she explained, could be used to subvert norms and critique the status quo, and she cited her own low-turned-high influences—Berlin Dada and Warner Brother cartoons and Marx Brothers movies—and the generation of performance artists that crossed boundaries in the 1980s, including Eric Bogosian, Ann Magnuson, Spalding Gray, and the NEA Four.(2) Without Fraser’s permission or benediction, I would add these names and Fraser’s to a longer lineage of modernist and post-modernist agitators reliably noted in Western art histories: the roster starts with Marcel Duchamp and extends to include Piero Manzoni, Yves Klein, the Situationists, Yayoi Kusama, Vito Acconci, Chris Burden, Adrian Piper, Howardena Pindell, David Hammons, the Guerrilla Girls, Coco Fusco and Guillermo Gómez-Peña, and William Pope.L. The common thread among all these comic practices is the <i>épater le bourgeois</i> spirit and the poke in the eye intent toward institutions, attitudes ardently communicated through wisecracking bodies.<br><br>Funny is always peculiarly funny with Fraser. She is not a stand-up. Appropriate to her own claim about the institutionalization of institutional critique, the jokes in her work are grounded in shared knowledge among the insiders that are “us.”(3) Even when she’s on a stage and in front of larger than exhibition-opening reception crowds, Fraser closes the distance between herself and those who are present. In much of the photo and video documentation of her performances, the camera provides looks at audiences, which seem to be following along and enjoying Fraser’s shtick. Well prepared to be ribbed, the gathered still chuckle and chortle (at least a little bit). <i>Agent-provocateur</i> is a role below Fraser’s pay grade: mostly, she does expect us to sit there and take it, it being a heavy dose of inveighing. Now, in 2015, we are aware (as Fraser is) that her bits won’t turn us resolutely against the museum, the art star system, and the spectacle of contemporary art markets and their inequities. So, what does Andrea Fraser really want?<br><br>Andrea Fraser is serious.<br><br>Some of Fraser’s recent projects (and some of her earliest) indicate that her institutional critique is not singularly “about” art.(4) Fraser would be hard-pressed to deny the charge of her detractors that she is presenting information.(5) To what end? In character<br>and outside of it, Fraser comes across as a know-it-all, a persona who often draws an especially pointed ire when located in a self-possessed female body. So her portrayal of men in Men on the Line: <i>Men Committed to Feminism, KPFK, 1972</i> (2012), a work that she reprised at the Brava Theater in San Francisco on October 30, 2015, is a clever move that does not shift our attention away from her sex and gender. Instead, it underscores our predictable fixation upon those axes of identity. Because Fraser does not, mockingly, don a full drag king-like costume (à la Eleanor Antin) for <i>Men on the Line</i>, the performance has a better chance of indexically revealing its inspiration: a public radio station’s broadcast from 1972 made for listeners, made to be heard. Fraser’s research into and transcription of the show’s audio track are important aspects of her creative labor; another is the representation of a self-conscious, on-air rap session among four men discussing their feminist politics.<br><br>What daylight is there between Men on the Line and Anna Deavere Smith’s signature productions, say, the interactive project of <i>Notes from the Field: Doing Time in Education—The California Chapter</i> (2015) on the American school-to-prison pipeline? Both are scripted texts taken from “life.” Neither is improv, nor would either artist see the works as social practice. The distinction is drawn because of the different discursive frames of entertainment in which <i>Men on the Line</i> and Notes from the Field resides. Smith’s work is acting and Fraser’s is avowedly not. In Men on the Line, Fraser gives us speakers who are trying to work something out and who are not held up for ridicule. While it would be easy to present the conversation in Men on the Line as a laughable relic of a bygone time and space—self-consciously liberal, white Los Angeles of the 1970s—Fraser strains to avoid that outcome. Instead, her intent in <i>Men on the Line</i> is to offer their process as a desirable model for investigation and analysis—individual and collective.(6)<br><br>In <i>Men on the Line</i>, as in <i>Not Just a Few of Us</i> (2014), Fraser steps away from identifiably funny business. The mined dialogue in these projects retains its authentic charge, and it can make us wince. After a reading about societally constructed gender roles, Fraser, in the character of Bob Kruger in <i>Men on the Line</i>, confesses: “I felt very guilty about my penis. . . . I want to rebel. I could be one of those radical female feminists that I spoke about, that I couldn’t—about earlier, that I couldn’t relate to.”(7) Fraser is interested in the uncomfortable and unresolved emotions evident in such statements, and in the generative potential of bringing narrative that is searching and anxious into art practice grounded in struggle and conflict. <i>Men on the Line</i> asks many implicit questions, among them: “What’s the right thing to do?” Fraser lets us know that there are no simple answers; there is only more work to do.<br><br>Notes:<br><br>(1) Andrea Fraser in conversation with Judy Batalion, “High Time for Humor, in The Laughing Stock,” <i>iThe Laughing Stalk: Live Comedy and Its Audiences</i>, ed.

When Andrea Fraser decided not to share specific artworks with the “On Our Mind” group, it launched a discussion about the production of value, refusal as performance, and the nature of generosity.</i><br><br>The intended structure of the “On Our Mind” seminar was to focus on a close reading of one artwork by Andrea Fraser at each meeting. Tanya Zimbardo and I were asked to select the first artwork and readings for the group. We chose Fraser’s 2008 video installation <i>Projection</i>, which neither of us had had the opportunity to view before. On the morning of our seminar meeting, however, we were told that the artist had decided not to share the work. In the absence of the video, the group read a previously published transcript of <i>Projection</i>. Though we spent some time talking about the transcript in conjunction with a short clip of the piece available on Tate Modern’s website, neither proved a sufficient substitute.(1) In the end, the seminar discussion, which took place on April 20, 2015, veered toward the topic of Andrea’s refusal itself. I decided my contribution would take the form of a transcript as well—what follows this brief introduction is an edited excerpt of that evening’s discussion.<br><br>Fraser’s initial explanation for not lending <i>Projection</i> was that she intended it to be viewed as a dual-screen installation. We understood her concern, though as “arts professionals” (curators, artists, professors, writers), we had watched preview copies of installation works before. Perhaps we could have arranged to install the work for a private screening at the Wattis, which has the proper equipment, space, and other technical requirements. Fraser offered the group access to some other titles, but she also stipulated that any additional works we wanted to view would be released only if the Wattis agreed to buy some of them. Fraser’s acquisitions proposal ended up complicating our response to her stated concerns regarding the viewing conditions for <i>Projection</i>. It also prompted us to reevaluate the nature of our academic seminar and the contradictions and complicities involved in the kind of work Andrea and we were performing. In the end, the Wattis and CCA’s library jointly purchased five unlimited-edition DVDs from Fraser. The acquisition, however, was not finalized until April 2016, after our year-long project was over.(2)<br><br>The capacity of artists to develop an economy around their work is challenging for all but the 2% who sell to the 1% via blue-chip galleries and art fairs.(3) This is particularly problematic for female artists, and even more so for those working in performance (perhaps<br>this is one reason why Fraser stopped making videos as unlimited editions and started selling her video pieces through commercial galleries as limited editions around 2001). The range of issues brought up by the encounter between Fraser, the Wattis, and the participants could be placed in the broader context of W.A.G.E certification (in which Fraser is involved)(4) and legislative attempts to establish artist resale royalty rights.<br><br>Participation in the Wattis seminar was by invitation and required a year-long commitment. I was interested in the project because I wanted to revisit some of Fraser’s earlier work and view pieces I hadn’t seen before. Fraser and I were formed in part by the same downtown New York City art scene (in the years I worked at the New Museum and hung out at the Whitney Program). The politics of institutional critique in which I was invested during my twenties hadn’t held up to my middle-aged self. Aside from a bit of nostalgia, I wanted to think about whether any of it was salvageable.<br><br>Some may wonder why the participants agreed to devote so much time to an endeavor for which we didn’t get paid (though for full disclosure, I am receiving a $100 honorarium for this essay). As an academic and sometime curator, the Wattis seminar provided me a regular forum to meet with interesting colleagues—a kind of faculty seminar not otherwise supported by CCA. The lack of predictable art world “deliverables” was also appealing to me. There wouldn’t be the typical one-person exhibition and catalogue to organize at the end of the project. It was<br>a loose format but also relatively long term, which allowed for more in-depth and creative exploration. I was invested in the notion that a certain generosity is implicit in this kind of intellectual and creative exchange.<br><br>Or was the seminar format actually exploitative? Was the Wattis using our cultural capital to produce programming without compensating us as consultants? I find that line hard to argue given that, with the exception of Fraser’s <i>Men on the Line</i> performance, the lectures and events were primarily organized by us and for us; they were open to the general public but attracted a relatively small and specialized audience. Did the seminar instead exploit Fraser by expecting her to perform some kind of free “artistic service” for the Wattis? Fraser was paid for performing <i>Men on the Line</i>, but the loan of our “study materials” was anticipated as a professional courtesy. Fraser and I are both tenured professors with steady paychecks, meaning that we don’t have to piece together adjunct positions, type for dollars, or take on unrelated work like many others in our field. Should this shared institutional privilege have influenced the nature of our exchange? Would providing the seminar with access to her video work fall under the rubric of scholarly reciprocity? Most academic work is expected to be done for “free,” whether publishing an article in a journal or presenting a paper at a conference. When Fraser established the expectation that her work should be bought, did it in turn expose us as consumers rather than producers ourselves?<br><br>Issues of remuneration and exploitation relate directly to what the Italian sociologist Maurizio Lazzarato terms “the value of immaterial labor” and what American economist Tyler Cowen describes as the trade-off between “pecuniary vs. non-pecuniary” benefits. They both speak to the kind of social relations set in motion by creative/aesthetic work in the new economy, albeit from opposing ideologies. Lazzarato identifies immaterial labor as central to both the “global organization of production” and the “process of valorization” in our fluid post-Fordist economy. Workers and artists become entrepreneurs in a labor market characterized by precariousness, hyperexploitation, and mobility.(5) Cowen, on the other hand, attempts to explain why artists might choose to reject the market in order to “derive non-pecuniary returns from particular forms of labor.” This phenomenon occurs in other creative industries as well, where professionals choose to shift from “earnwork” to “volwork”—a move that represents an initial decrease in earnings, but in fact functions within a postindustrial system as “the major story of economic growth.”(6)<br><br>Cowen’s libertarian-based theory is crass and simplistic despite the comparative statistics and elaborate proofs. Yet the idea that people might want to wrest notions of value away from a reductive capitalist logic has been fueling much of the conversation in the art world around social practices, and gift and sharing economies. To follow the logic of Lazzarato’s immaterial labor, much of what passes as relational art these days is really just another high-yield means of satisfying the desires of the experience economy. Academia, as a supposedly alternative symbolic economy of free exchange and opportunity, can also be critiqued for its role in this totalizing system. This is particularly true in the private sector where prohibitive tuition costs and outdated admissions criteria favor an already existing elite. Just as the appearance of transgression in artistic practice is essential to the cycle of exchange between cultural and financial capital, so can it be similarly harnessed in academia (though it is often referred to as the friendlier-sounding “innovation”).<br><br>Fraser has questioned on more than one occasion how artists can continue to rationalize their participation in this economy. At the same time, she has encouraged curators, critics, art historians, and artists to “withdraw their cultural capital from this market.”(7) My takeaway from that brief moment of Fraser’s refusal was that she did not think our seminar qualified as a sufficient act of withdrawal, nor did she regard our exchange as mutually beneficial. Requiring us to buy a work for the purposes of study eliminated the possibility of a symbolic exchange of legitimacy. The time we spent this past year focusing on Fraser’s artistic practice didn’t qualify as an even trade-off in terms of “professional consecration,” with all the unsavory associations this label implies.(8) Our affective investment in the seminar could be described as negation, to cite the Freudian term Fraser often employs—an anamnesis on our part, as well as hers, as to what we’re all doing and for whom.(9) Or finally, as one seminar member suggested, maybe it was simply a case of benign neglect. Maybe Fraser was too busy to deal with our low-profile project, and we’re just overthinking it.<br><br>______________________<br><br>Transcript of Fraser “On My Mind” seminar,<br>April 20, 2016<br>Present: Wattis curator & head of programs Jamie Stevens, Wattis associate curator Leila Grothe, Karen Fiss, Jacqueline Francis, Ben Furstenberg, Jeanne Gerrity, Bean Gilsdorf, Patricia Maloney, Ross Sappenfield, Tanya Zimbardo, and Anonymous.<br><br>______________________<br><br><br><u>JS</u>: The idea for this seminar is to present close readings of individual works, and Karen and Tanya have identified <i>Projection</i>, a two-channel video installation as the work by Andrea Fraser that they wanted to talk about today. In her initial reply, it seemed like we would gain access to the videos, but ultimately Andrea indicated that she’s not prepared to give us this work to view, and I think there are fair reasons for this decision. I’ll let Leila describe what Andrea said and where the situation stands in regards to access to her work in general.<br><br><u>LG</u>: Installation works are generally off limits, although she has given us her biography, a complete list of works, a bibliography, and a list of all her unlimited edition titles. She has suggested that the group come up with a list of works we’d like to focus on in our seminar and would like to request. She’s hoping that through the CCA library, we might<br>be able to work out an acquisition, and then in response to that, she would open up some titles as preview copies.<br><br><u>JS</u>: Andrea seems to be very open about this potential acquisition process. It’s not like she named her price, and we must meet it. We can talk about which titles we want, and we’ll negotiate a suitable fee structure—we’ll send an email encouraging you all to read this list and for those leading the upcoming seminars, or even for our own research, if there are titles that would be particularly valuable, let us know; otherwise we’ll decide ourselves.<br><br><u>LG</u>: Despite her turning down this particular request, if we really want an excerpt of a specific work, I think we could convince Andrea to share something with us. What’s confusing to me is that in the taped conversation on Tate’s website, she shared a four minute segment of the piece [<i>Projection</i>]. Maybe it’s because the actual work was in the same building, and people could see it in its proper context, but she has extracted other moments before.<br><br><u>JS</u>: One final comment. If it was another medium we were talking about, I think we’d still give ourselves permission to produce close readings of the work—for instance, if it were a painting or a sculpture. So I hope that we all feel empowered to talk about this work without that intimacy or unfettered access.<br><br><u>LG</u>: Andrea gave us a list of titles that she suggested the library acquire, but by no means is she making that decision for us, it’s just the pieces she thought would be interesting to us.<br><br><u>KF</u>: I should explain why we are being taped. That was my request for today, because we got the news about Andrea not lending Projection in the eleventh hour, and I thought it could tie into last week’s discussion about institutional critique. As institutional critique became historicized, I think it was also framed nostalgically; it’s as if we’re talking about the historical avant-garde all over again. I was disappointed and annoyed by Andrea’s decision, but also interested in what it might say about the position of the artist within the discourse of institutional critique. It hasn’t been sufficiently discussed or theorized, so I thought of using the transcript of 6this seminar as the basis for my contribution, or as a collaborative effort, for our final writing project. I am interested to hear everyone’s perspectives about the terms set for our seminar to view work. For me, as a professor of contemporary art, who teaches a lot of time-based and installation art, it is a constant challenge in the classroom—not being able to show students many of the artworks I think are important for them to know. I feel like my hands are tied in terms of what I can expose them to. Also in terms of my current book project dealing with globalization, I’m interested in how artworks circulate, or get pulled out of circulation, for the purposes of the market.<br><br><u>TZ</u>: For today’s discussion, Karen and I wanted to choose a more recent work that neither of us had seen before. Since we aren’t going to be able to view <i>Projection</i>, we found two related resources: one is a talk by Andrea given in conjunction with the presentation of the work at the Tate; the other is an essay by Andrea that elaborates in more detail her interest in Bourdieu and psychoanalytic theory at that moment—the essay was written at the time she was producing the transcripts for <i>Projection</i>.(10)<br><br><u>BF</u>: I read the script—it’s not a perfect emulation of the work, but the article talking about the friction between Bourdieu and psychoanalysis was really interesting. One also always wonders whether the transcript is literally accurate, is it complete?<br><br><u>A</u>: I saw <i>Projection</i> installed in a big museum environment. The acoustics left a lot to be desired: you could hear the conversations outside, and the projection was hard to see—so can one really assume that because it’s a prestigious organization, it would necessarily provide the best venue?<br><br><u>JS</u>: You bring up an interesting issue about the promise of an institution delivering the right level<br>of care...<br><br><u>BF</u>: To provide the perfect environment.<br><br><u>JS</u>: I don’t feel that critical of Andrea for our situation now. I don’t mind artists feeling a bit overprotective about the environment in which their work is seen, it doesn’t really bother me that much, but I do think that in making these kinds of demands, you rarify other spaces.<br><br><u>TZ</u>: This seminar isn’t a public panel or talk. It’s a private conversation and it’s a group of people who for the most part are not only often engaged in looking at, studying, and showing work, but we are also familiar with preview copies for research purposes. We understand the spatial considerations and that we would not have been looking at an ideal presentation. So this was surprising.<br><br><u>KF</u>: I would understand if we were whipping up a public exhibition or screening of the piece, but we’re meeting in a gallery space, we are all arts professionals, and most of us curate exhibitions. Given the terms of what this group is doing, I find it problematic. I guess I’m always wary of that kind of control over what works will and will not be seen. I don’t know what is actually at play here—if it is just about meeting the expectations of proper installation.<br><br><u>A</u>: Do you think it’s about wanting to create an economy around the work? This is what I’ve been thinking. Andrea plays on this dual sense of investment. I’m sure we’re willing to make the intellectual investment in the work, but she’s insisting on the other kind of investment. In the Tate talk, she went into feelings of shame attached to <i>Untitled</i>, particularly in the way it couldn’t achieve the same kind of economic value as her painter friends’ work. No matter how much personal sacrifice she made<br>for the work, she could still never reap the same rewards. I don’t know, I was just thinking about it in those terms.<br><br><u>KF</u>: These are all interventions in the public sphere. They are all ways of defining the public sphere and engaging in a set of relations. Is there an inconsistency between Andrea’s psychoanalytic reading of Bourdieu, and the conceptual thinking behind her decision not to give us access to her work?<br><br><u>A</u>: Maybe it’s also about intervening into this situation here, which is about her as a potential site for work. Maybe not a work with a title, but a site or a position. The supposed generosity of us investing intellectually in her work as a group might be interpreted as beneficial because we’re at an educational establishment. Maybe she’s trying to intervene in that with a different kind of gesture, one that we wouldn’t expect.<br><br><u>BF</u>: The withholding you mean?<br><br><u>A</u>: I don’t know what that produces, but maybe it’s worth considering.<br><br><u>BF</u>: We’re sensing some resistance, Andrea, let’s work through that. [laughter]<br><br><u>PM</u>: I’m wondering since she’s also an academic, by withholding, is she making us hyperconscious of the privilege this discussion has over the work itself? Is it the facilitating factor for this conversation, rather than existing as an entity in and of itself?<br><br><u>KF</u>: Or is she saying her time is more valuable<br>than ours?<br><br><u>JG</u>: If she isn’t letting us have the videos for economic reasons, that seems consistent with her work. I agree that artists are often taken advantage of by institutions, but it doesn’t sound like that’s where Andrea’s taking issue. It sounds like she doesn’t want <i>Projection</i> to be seen outside of an installation context.<br><br><u>BF</u>: There are multiple issues here. One is the question of financial value and whether that is really something she believes in, but also the question of ownership, authorship, and control. Who does art really belong to? Is it the possession of the artist?<br>Someone may own it as a commodity, but should artists have control over their product? On the other hand, art is this intersubjective site of social production, so why should the artist get to be the entrepreneur, the owner of the process?<br><br><u>JS</u>: I agree that there are contradictions at stake with these questions, but I wonder if there is any such thing as consistency between a political position or perspective and an approach to being an artist participating in the art world. I think that it’s a struggle to be an artist, to survive as an artist, to create any kind of economy around your life as<br>an artist. Andrea Fraser is a teacher and all this<br>other stuff …<br><br><u>KF</u>: True, although speaking also from the security of an academic position, Andrea is not one of the artists I necessarily worry about in those terms… Perhaps it has to do with differing levels of “investment” of acceptance of academia as a platform for knowledge production…<br><br><u>A</u>: Maybe it’s not about the person’s struggle. Maybe there is a consistency, in fact, in making any situation reflexive. I mean she’s not letting us get away thinking we’re on the right side here.<br><br><u>JF</u>: I don’t think we can underestimate self-editing. I’ve been thinking about self-editing because I’m currently writing about someone destroying his work of the 1940s as he enters the 60s and 70s. Separately, Chris Dercon and Andrea get into it at the Tate—in their taped conversation. He’s calling her out saying she is inconsistent, and she replies that he’s right—that she is inconsistent. She’s been getting it here from us too—what she hasn’t done, what she’s not doing, how she’s letting us all down, etc. Maybe we can just put it out there and then move on!<br><br><u>A</u>: When I heard that she refused, I also felt really pissed off, and then I started thinking why is she doing this. ... But what I mean is, why turn this into an issue about her personality…it’s not an interesting way of dealing with it. Why do we need her to be generous? Why do we need that?<br><br><u>BF</u>: But we’re not necessarily doing that, and she’s doing that as an artist. She’s willfully blurred those categories quite a bit.<br><br><u>PM</u>: But it is also ascribing a lot of intentionality to one act. Maybe she just got up and was like “No.” Today I’m gonna say no. [laughter]. Not to be dismissive, but maybe she just had low blood sugar or something. In the realm of inconsistencies, that’s how inconsistencies happen, by being very human.<br><br><u>JF</u>: Yeah, very human.<br><br><u>JS</u>: I have two conflicting feelings about this: on the one hand, for me a really important part of this group is to give ourselves permission to think about Andrea as an artist and think about the formal components of her work, and not to rely on the text. And in this instance, she’s basically telling us to go to secondary material, where actually the work comes off as hyper intentional and determined. In my experiences of seeing Andrea’s work in person, a sense of vulnerability seems to be such a crucial ingredient. By going to the secondary material, that vulnerability is withheld.<br><br><u>PM</u>: We can’t dismiss the idea that her refusal is a performative gesture. This is where we enter into a negotiation with her, which is such an essential element of her work.<br><br><u>JG</u>: So much of her work is scripted. She obviously wants to have control over the situation.<br><br><u>KF</u>: I suppose by joining this group, I assumed I was entering into some kind of informal agreement with Andrea. What is considered reasonable or equitable under these circumstances? The nature of the relationship between artists and curators, artists and critics, is never really vetted. It also calls attention to the question of access. Who gets access to what artworks, limited-edition DVDs … what is the balance between artists “trying to make a living” and work only being seen by those who can travel to select exhibitions or art fairs or, of course, who have the means to buy it for themselves.<br><br><u>JS</u>: These are pertinent questions, and it’s our responsibility as an institution and as a group to engage in this discussion. I think it’s important<br>to state that although we did get a “no” in this instance, Andrea has in fact been extremely supportive and collegiate, and our exchanges are<br>not at all antagonistic.<br><br><u>KF</u>: I also think there are many instances where institutions completely exploit artists and writers. What was appealing to me about this format was that it was about sharing knowledge locally. None of us participants are being paid or compensated in any way—though you do feed us potato chips and the occasional beer. For me, this loose format foregrounds creative exchange and sharing ideas; there has to be a certain generosity in the spirit of us coming together. If not us, then in what other intellectual and professional contexts would one be granted the privilege to view original work?<br><br><u>BF</u>: I like that those issues are coming up and that there is a prismatic effect. Who knows whether she’s scripting this; she didn’t script what we’re talking about, but I imagine it’s somewhere in between. I like that it’s an opportunity not just to look at Andrea’s work, but to look at relationships between institutions, or between figures at different sites in the production not just of art, but art discourse. I was cracking up when Wattis staff described her communication because it becomes almost some weird artwork that’s a description of “a communiqué from Andrea Fraser,” and it’s this affective object that you’re mediating.<br><br>Notes:<br><br>(1) http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/video/andrea-fraser-conversation-chris-dercon, accessed June 8, 2016.<br><br>(2) The five unlimited-edition DVDs purchased from Andrea Fraser were: Official Welcome, 2001/2003; Welcome to the Wadsworth, 1992; <br><i>Museum Highlights: A Gallery Talk</i>, 1989; <i>Inaugural Speech</i>, 1997; and <i>May I Help You?</i>, 1991.<br><br>(3) Statistic, though a bit dated, from a report by Columbia University Research Center for Arts and Culture; quoted in Nato Thompson’s interview with W.A.G.E. “Labor Movement,” <i>Artforum</i>, March 2011.<br><br>(4) W.A.G.E.

Commissioned by the MICA Foundation and initially performed in October 2001, Official Welcome is a critique that relies upon the audience’s ability to register and navigate a specific set of social relations. Fraser stands at a podium, enacting the roles of various “artist” and “supporter” characters, using language appropriated from articles by and about established art world figures. Each of these characters represents a known “type” with well-defined parameters (the condescending patron, the bitter mid-career artist, etc.); each functions as a kind of framing device. Fraser marks the shifts between these personas through changes in language, gesture, and intonation, and just as each frame becomes resolved, it shifts. For this performance to be understood and appreciated by the audience, the content must not only be recognizable, conveying meaning, but—crucially—the artist and the audience must hold between them a shared sense of value for these operations.<br><br>2. Tzvetan Todorov observed that every utterance is oriented toward a social horizon, and <i>Official Welcome</i> demonstrates that its particular social horizon is bounded by an unacknowledged agreement, held in common between performer and audience, regarding the conditioned social reality of art world personas and how they are meant to act and interact with one another. Thus the space of this performance is not just the podium at which the performer stands, but it is the entire room, and indeed, the larger set of social relations that both<br>she and the audience occupy and participate in. At 8\'41\" Fraser says, “I hope I can implicate people in my work.”<br><br>3. Fraser’s work has often been discussed in terms of institutional critique, but seldom in relation to the practice of appropriation. Yet a similar dynamic of mutually understood social significance operates within both gestures. Institutional critique relies on a sense of shared value, and to achieve its principle goals of defamiliarizing the known—or exposing and problematizing the force behind codified, tacit structures—one must work within communal codes and utilize the signs and signifiers of hierarchical institutional power. Likewise, the energetic thrust of visual appropriation depends entirely on recognition. Condemnation and in-jokes alike depend on shared frames of reference.<br><br>4. Fraser alternates between the two categories of “artist” and “supporter” in <i>Official Welcome.</i> The piece starts as sober, decorous, and gracious and rapidly lurches toward dissolution: the “artists” begin to stutter, insult the audience, indulge delusions of persecution and grandeur, moon the audience, and disrobe completely; interspersed with these displays, the “supporters” awkwardly stroke egos, smile tightly at gaffes, and flap about trying to recover their own status at the podium by praising these buffoons: “That’s great! Isn’t she great?! She’s great! Exciting work.”<br><br>5. The most famous example of mimicry in the natural world is the viceroy butterfly; to avoid predation, it replicates the colors, patterns, and behavior of the poisonous monarch. The artist who wishes to critique an institution (without being eaten—or worse, ignored) must contend with the necessity to mimic the mechanisms that already exist within the institution in order for the critique to be legible. But such appropriative strategies come at a cost: as with all spectacle, re-performing dynamics of power has a way of legitimizing those dynamics. Fraser herself has admitted that in her work, these energies are “bound up as part of my own ambition to be part of [the] institution.” Entomologists tell us that the difference between the viceroy and the monarch is that “viceroy flight is faster and more erratic.” The king, assured of his status, is calm; only the imitators thrash about in a nervous stew of ambition and pretension.<br><br>6. Fraser appropriates the language that invisibly buttresses the art world’s monolithic structures. In re-performing it, she lays bare its self-congratulatory, hopeful, oily, angry (and above all, deadly earnest) mechanisms. But in exposing these structures, <i>Official Welcome</i> also functions as a shibboleth for the audience’s insider knowledge. Are you in on the joke? Do you know when to laugh? Do you get the references to Tracey Emin, Damien Hirst, and Vanessa Beecroft? Are you one of us? Like all operations involving power dynamics, the work defines an inside and an outside, a delineation separating inclusion from exclusion. In defining this boundary, however, the work necessarily polices it. As much as it might be “appropriation art” and “institutional critique,” <i>Official Welcome</i> is primarily the performance of a certain shared worldview. Its framing devices have value because the audience has a participatory desire oriented toward the very same network of power relations.<br><br>7. It is true that art is a communicative act and that its utterances are always intended to fall on ears that can absorb them. But it is crucial to note that Fraser is using this principle, <i>art qua art</i>, to serve up her well-informed audience to themselves. She presents to them the system in which they participate—and thus perpetuate. These tropes have achieved the kind of status occupied by stereotypes: not entirely true and yet all too truthful for having become orthodoxy. That we can take pleasure in our recognition of these frames only illustrates our own collusion in manifesting them. If Fraser’s work falls into the category of “institutional critique,” then we, the audience, might just be the institution.',''),(477,1,'2017-07-14 03:48:03','2017-07-25 01:52:52',NULL,'<i>Jonas and Her Precursors</i>\r\nby Jordan Kantor',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'jonas-and-her-precursors-by-jordan-kantor',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',_binary 'Once I planned to make a survey of Jonas’s precursors. At first I thought she was as singular as the fabulous Phoenix; when I knew her better<br>I thought I recognized her voice, or her habits, in the art of various cultures and various ages. I shall record a few of them here, in chronological order.<br>The first is Noh, the Japanese dance-theater tradition. Dating back to the 14th century, Noh theater is highly stylized, with codified choreography and a narrow narrative repertoire determining the courses of action. Its performers usually wear masks, which deemphasize their personal identity and make them more like mediums. With all-male casts playing both male and female roles, Noh theater on some level presents gender as social performance, an idea whcih is theoretically refined in Jonas\'s work On a formal level, the clapping blocks used in Noh, which provide a percussive undertone to the actors’ vocal performances, prefigure Jonas\'s strategies for exploring the disconnection between sound and image. Noh performers would be perfectly at home in her <i>Delay Delay</i> (1972).<br><br>In the second tradition that happened to come to my attention, the affinity is of both form and voudon, which are included in the admirable <i>Divine Horsemen: The Living Gods of Haiti</i> by Maya Deren (edited and released posthumously in 1977). These ritualistic drawing practices emphasize the action of drawing rather than its product; its practitioners are focused on performance instead of authorship (to borrow a formulation from Roland Barthes). Voudon drawing specifically concerns itself wth the spiritual and mythical work of imagining the border between life and death, and the role the artist can play in that important imaginative task.<br><br>The third prefiguaration I found is in <i>Repetition</i> (1843) by Søren Kierkegaard. The affinity of both Jonas and Kierkegaard for repetition is known to almost everyone; what has not yet been brought out, as far as I know, is that Kierkegaard, like Jonas, addressed such questions of content through experimental form and structure, all the while with an eye to psychological effect. Indeed, how many remember that <i>Repetition</i> was published under the pseudonym Constantin Constantius (itself a repetition!) and with the subtitle “A Venture in Experimenting Psychology”? In Kierkegaard’s book, which ranges widely in its examination of ancient philosophy, personal reverie, and religious narrative, Constantius seeks to experience “authentic” repetition, only to discover this to be an impossible goal. In particular, the aesthetic sphere proves particularly inauthentic, characterized as it conventionally is by absorption and recollection, actions that are always backward looking. By selfconsciously thinking through repetition as a formal structure to enter present history, Kierkegaard models the re-conceptualization of time and experience in a way that rhymes nicely with concerns central to emergent postmodernism.<br><br>The fourth text proceeds from a more foreseeable source: the writings of Jorge Luis Borges. The Argentine’s obsession with mirrors, loops, and non-linear time is famous, as is his engagement with myth, the dream, and labyrinths. However, as much as his dazzling iconography and formal prowess loom large, Borges’s writings also tackle questions of time and artistic subjectivity in particularly pointed ways. In “Kafka and his Precursors” (1951), for example, the author reverses the traditional trajectory of models of influence, arguing for a past that is written in the present. Problematizing teleological narratives of history and classical notions of subjectivity in both this text and in his oeuvre as a whole, Borges rethinks causality, originality, history, and identity: all issues that Jonas’s work also incites us to consider anew.<br><br>My notes also include mention of the art historian Aby Warburg. When in 1896 Warburg visited the Hopi people of present-day Arizona, he was particularly interested in the snake dance rituals that he witnessed them perform. Both the look of the snake dance and what it endeavored to do—to communicate to the ancestral underworld through the snakes—touched Warburg deeply, and he returned to this experience in his later thinking about the cultic motives of art-making as a phenomenon. The art historian is also known for his last project: the iconic <i>Mnemosyne Atlas</i>, which he began in the late 1920s. By studying the transhistorical migration of visual resemblances and forms in art, Warburg drew novel correspondences between works from different times and contexts and, perhaps more importantly, provided a model of visual thinking at once analytic and highly intuitive. (In both projects, the topical content and structural logic can be understood as Jonas-like). If I am not mistaken, the heterogeneous selections I have mentioned resemble Jonas’s work: if I am not mistaken, not all of them resemble each other, and this fact is the significant one. Jonas\'s idiosyncrasy, in great or lesser degree, is present in each of these examples, but if Jonas had not worked, we would not perceive it; that is to say it would not exist. Borges’s <i>Labyrinths</i> are like a prophecy of Jones\'s works, but our readinf of Jonas refines and changes our reading of these stories perceptibly. Borges did not read them as we read them now. The word “precursor” is indispensable in the vocabulary of criticism, but one should try to purify it from every connotation of polemic or rivalry. The fact is that each artist creates her precursors. Her work modifies our conception of the past, as it will modify the future.  In this correlation the identity ofplurality of men matters not at all. The first Jonas of <i>Wind</i> (1968) is less a precursor of the Jonas of the shadowy myths and looped repetitions than is Kierkegaard or Borges.<br><br>Buenos Aires, 1951<br>San Francisco, 2014',''),(478,1,'2017-07-14 03:55:33','2017-07-25 01:39:55',NULL,'<i>Helen of Las Vegas, or the War Today</i>\r\nby Patricia Maloney',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'478',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',_binary 'The War is the first and only thing in the world today.(1) <br>– William Carlos Williams<br><br>Why do I doubt?

Instead, <i>Lines in the Sand</i> is the politics of war read through H.D.’s <i>Helen in Egypt</i>. According to a surviving fragment by Stesichorus of Sicily (640-555 B.C.E), from which H.D. crafts her book-length poem, Helen was never in Troy. “Helen of Troy was a phantom….The Greeks and Trojans alike fought for an illusion.”(3) It was a trade war, fought over gold, cinnabar, dried fish, and Chinese jade. Helen was as present as weapons of mass destruction.<br><br>But we cannot read <i>Lines in the Sand</i> merely as political theater, nor Helen as metaphor. Jonas places Helen not in Egypt but in the desert sands of Las Vegas, beside the ersatz monuments of the Luxor Hotel. In one moment, projected as video, Jonas stands on a low wall, waving her arms in a fitful choreography. A construction vehicle—a feller buncher—with a lowered arm passes before her; it appears like a battering ram. “Obviously Helen has walked through time into another dimension,” H.D. writes, and Jonas enacts this.4 Location is irrelevant; regardless of place, Helen is always absent—“Past, present, future, she was never there”—and therefore, war is always at hand.(5) William Carlos Williams asserts the same thing in his “Introduction” to <i>The Wedge</i>: The “today” he refers to is the continuity of time, an ever-insistent now.<br><br>Poet Susan Howe echoes this sentiment in her 2003 conversation with Jonas, invoking the <i>Iliad’s</i> brevity and brutality as resonant in our contemporary moment. Howe and Jonas, who have been friends since the early 1960s , are the same age, and Howe describes the violence of their mutual childhood: “[B]arked orders, bombs, swastikas, marching soldiers, newsreel shots of children being torn from their parents, such fear everywhere.”6 Suspended and re-enacted, war is a trauma that is lived again and again, without comprehension or resolution. The actions of <i>Lines in the Sand</i> are fragmented; in her customary style, Jonas lays down one movement and picks up another without transitions between them. But embedded in the structure are layers of repetition, gestures such as drawing and pacing performed over and over, each iteration just slightly removed from the previous, a wobble or gap to create difference, but not progress. “The War is the first and only thing in the world today.”<br><br>These gestures form the structure of the performance, which is the structure of a poem. In the conversation with Howe, Jonas describes how she arrives at her compositions by reading poets such as Williams. The movements described above—the passage from one scene to another and the asynchronous repetitions—eschew redundancy, which Williams himself rejects for poetry, ascribing to his art instead the efficiency of machines:<br><br>As in all machines, its movement is intrinsic, undulant, a physical more than a literary character. In a poem this movement is distinguished in each case by the character of the speech from which it arises.(7)<br><br>In <i>Lines in the Sand</i>, Jonas employs text as a soundtrack for, not a narration of, the performance; it is at once unassimilated yet inherent to every gesture. She works against the text with her images, creating a perceptible gap in the interplay between them that duplicates the variances—the wobble—found within the repeated gestures. <br><br>Williams argues that the poet composes his words “without distortion which would mar their exact significances.”(8) But Howe cautions us regarding the limits of language, noting that while it might “convey the essence of the violence of war,” the language of pain is writ only with great difficulty.99) H.D. articulates this further in <i>Tribute to Freud</i>, from which Jonas also recites:<br><br>The effect they have on mind and body is different. They are healing. They are real. They are as real in their dimension of length, breadth, thickness, as any of the bronze or marble or pottery or clay objects. But we cannot prove they are real.(10)<br><br><i>Lines in the Sand</i> hovers between this exactitude and this deficit. What we witness in the movements of Jonas and her three fellow performers are illusions conjured in an effort fill the space created by Helen’s absence, which exists not only as a physical void, but also a state of incomprehensibility. <br><br>Jonas notes that, while editing <i>Lines in the Sand</i>, “With every choice I made, I was thinking of the situation in the world.”11 Williams states that the arts do not exist apart from or as a diversion from war; artistic activities are as “compatible with frustration” as any other aspect of life. Perceived through this double lens of worldly consciousness and historical compatibility, <i>Lines in the Sand</i> does not simply reinterpret contemporary events through myth; it provides us with a language for a war we know is real, but for which we can perceive no end.<br><br>Notes:<br><br>(1) William Carlos Williams, “Author’s Introduction (The Wedge),” <i>Selected Essays of William Carlos Williams</i> (New Directions, 1969), p. 255. <br><br>(2) H.D., <i>Helen in Egypt</i> (New Directions, 1974), pp. 31, 34, 35.

A low cement-block wall borders the yard. She is standing on the wall: a lithe and small-boned woman in her sixties, wearing an apricot-colored dress of transparent gauze over a silky undershift, with trousers under that, and black sunglasses. Her head is wrapped in a blue scarf—we can’t see it in detail, because the scene is shot from the middle distance. In one hand she holds a sheaf of something grain-like; in the other a length of white veil-like material. She is dancing, waving her frond, manipulating her veil as it flies up in the wind, unfurls, collapses around her. Sometimes, conversely, her hands are empty, gesturing. The footage feels sped-up slightly, so that her movements are herky-jerky, puppet-like. But since nothing else in the frame moves, the artist’s spastic-yet-elastic gestures appear exclusively her own, as if she were possessed, like a bacchante—or as if the cinematic mechanism were operating from inside her body.<br><br>Two hands, two objects, two dresses, two sides of the wall. The frond is <i>like</i> grain; the cloth is <i>like</i> a veil. The dance is like a puppet’s or a ritually maddened girl’s. But, in <i>Lines in the Sand</i> as elsewhere in Jonas’s art, similitudes multiply and each arises out of and phases into every other; every detail is contingent, fluid. In this scene—presumably—the performer makes herself an avatar for Helen of Troy as described in H.D.’s <i>Helen in Egypt</i> (1961). Jonas takes this poem as a source-text for her project. Yet “source” implies too tight a filiation, for H.D.’s epic is itself an essay in repetition-with-a-difference. Paris and Achilles each see Helen on the walls at Troy, as H.D. tells us. “But she was never there.” Helen has been doubled, left as a phantom haunting the palace under siege, while her consciousness is “transposed or translated” to a liminal plane or vision-state called Egypt.<br><br>In <i>Lines in the Sand</i>, we watch elongated shadows, male and female, argue on a beach and later, black-and-white photographs from a 1910 tour of the Nile flicker before the lamp of a projector. (The young tourist photographed in broad-brimmed hat and flowing skirts will become Joan Jonas’s grandmother.) Live onstage, a young man (Sung Hwan Kim) lies down to die or dream in a shallow sandbox, and an older man in white pajamas (Henk Visch) reads passages of H.D.’s text. The soundtrack, composed in 2002 by Paul D. Miller a.k.a. DJ Spooky and remixed live for the 2004 performance by Stephen Vitiello, segues from droning static to Yoruba drums to Satie to the Carter Family. And the video returns to Vegas; the camera cruises past the Luxor Hotel & Casino on the Strip to gaze at the black-glass pyramid and uneroded, simpering Sphinx. The herky-jerky dance comes around again onstage as Jonas and another woman (Ragani Haas) perform in tandem, the video washing over their live bodies in an edge-to-edge barrage of megawatt neon. Each is wearing a papier-mâché dog mask.<br><br>Jonas draws from a kaleidoscopic repository of narratives and actions, engaging not only a given plot or method but also her audience’s prior associations with it; as a master storyteller and mythographer, she sculpts what we already (think we) recognize—Helen of Troy, the white flag of surrender, the idea of the Middle East or “Egypt”—and beams it back to us disrupted and renewed. The palpitatingly physical, real-time manipulation of immaterial materials such as memory and association, not to mention sound and moving image, is Jonas’s métier.<br><br>“No art is beneath your power,” H.D.’s Achilles says to Helen in rage or fear or admiration. <i>Lines in the Sand</i> was produced in the grim and anxious period between 9/11 and the American invasion of Iraq—another war, in another desert, fought (as H.D. says of the Trojan war) “for an illusion.” Jonas is dancing on the wall. Then from the right side of the frame, a huge red truck comes into view. A hoist-arm juts over the cab, making a horizontal V like a monster’s jaws.

A low cement-block wall borders the yard. She is standing on the wall: a lithe and small-boned woman in her sixties, wearing an apricot-colored dress of transparent gauze over a silky undershift, with trousers under that, and black sunglasses. Her head is wrapped in a blue scarf—we can’t see it in detail, because the scene is shot from the middle distance. In one hand she holds a sheaf of something grain-like; in the other a length of white veil-like material. She is dancing, waving her frond, manipulating her veil as it flies up in the wind, unfurls, collapses around her. Sometimes, conversely, her hands are empty, gesturing. The footage feels sped-up slightly, so that her movements are herky-jerky, puppet-like. But since nothing else in the frame moves, the artist’s spastic-yet-elastic gestures appear exclusively her own, as if she were possessed, like a bacchante—or as if the cinematic mechanism were operating from inside her body.<br><br>Two hands, two objects, two dresses, two sides of the wall. The frond is <i>like</i> grain; the cloth is <i>like</i> a veil. The dance is like a puppet’s or a ritually maddened girl’s. But, in <i>Lines in the Sand</i> as elsewhere in Jonas’s art, similitudes multiply and each arises out of and phases into every other; every detail is contingent, fluid. In this scene—presumably—the performer makes herself an avatar for Helen of Troy as described in H.D.’s <i>Helen in Egypt</i> (1961). Jonas takes this poem as a source-text for her project. Yet “source” implies too tight a filiation, for H.D.’s epic is itself an essay in repetition-with-a-difference. Paris and Achilles each see Helen on the walls at Troy, as H.D. tells us. “But she was never there.” Helen has been doubled, left as a phantom haunting the palace under siege, while her consciousness is “transposed or translated” to a liminal plane or vision-state called Egypt.<br><br>In <i>Lines in the Sand</i>, we watch elongated shadows, male and female, argue on a beach and later, black-and-white photographs from a 1910 tour of the Nile flicker before the lamp of a projector. (The young tourist photographed in broad-brimmed hat and flowing skirts will become Joan Jonas’s grandmother.) Live onstage, a young man (Sung Hwan Kim) lies down to die or dream in a shallow sandbox, and an older man in white pajamas (Henk Visch) reads passages of H.D.’s text. The soundtrack, composed in 2002 by Paul D. Miller a.k.a. DJ Spooky and remixed live for the 2004 performance by Stephen Vitiello, segues from droning static to Yoruba drums to Satie to the Carter Family. And the video returns to Vegas; the camera cruises past the Luxor Hotel & Casino on the Strip to gaze at the black-glass pyramid and uneroded, simpering Sphinx. The herky-jerky dance comes around again onstage as Jonas and another woman (Ragani Haas) perform in tandem, the video washing over their live bodies in an edge-to-edge barrage of megawatt neon. Each is wearing a papier-mâché dog mask.<br><br>Jonas draws from a kaleidoscopic repository of narratives and actions, engaging not only a given plot or method but also her audience’s prior associations with it; as a master storyteller and mythographer, she sculpts what we already (think we) recognize—Helen of Troy, the white flag of surrender, the idea of the Middle East or “Egypt”—and beams it back to us disrupted and renewed. The palpitatingly physical, real-time manipulation of immaterial materials such as memory and association, not to mention sound and moving image, is Jonas’s métier.<br><br>“No art is beneath your power,” H.D.’s Achilles says to Helen in rage or fear or admiration. <i>Lines in the Sand</i> was produced in the grim and anxious period between 9/11 and the American invasion of Iraq—another war, in another desert, fought (as H.D. says of the Trojan war) “for an illusion.” Jonas is dancing on the wall. Then from the right side of the frame, a huge red truck comes into view. A hoist-arm juts over the cab, making a horizontal V like a monster’s jaws. As the truck crosses the frame, it seems to swallow the woman signaling on the wall.<br><br>But she is unconcerned, twitching and bopping as if she could go on forever.

Its material has been repurposed into a number of different works: it is both a thing and a vector, not unlike a mirror. Its recurrent status in Jonas’ work struck me courtesy of the unusual dating of the piece in the exhibition brochure for <i>Light Time Tales</i>, the mammoth survey of her work that was opened last year at Hangar Bicocca, Milan.<br><br>The three dates refer to the inclusion of <i>Street Scene with Chalk</i> as a component part of two larger projects: <i>Reading Dante</i> and <i>Mirage</i>. <i>Reading Dante</i> is dated twice, as 2008 and 2010, a period in which its configuration became complete. <i>Mirage</i> was a performance, later a film (<i>Mirage II</i>), made in 1976, which provoked the original outdoor actions that are recorded in <i>Street Scene</i>. Jonas describes the making of this document in an interview with <i>Bomb Magazine</i>:<br><br><i>“…there’s a projection where I’m drawing and erasing over the video footage of The Night Street Improvisation. One night in 1976, while I was working on my performance Mirage, I organized an improvisation near Wall Street, which was deserted at night. Andy Mann was the cameraman. Pat Steir and I played with several of my props—nine-foot metal cones and a six-foot metal hoop—while singing “Row Row Row Your Boat” and running about. An unidentified man joined us. I loved Fellini and this was as close as I got to that particular poet of film.”</i> (2)<br><br>The drawing and erasing element - in which Jonas’ hands rapidly trace and delete lines of movement within the 1970s document - was superimposed on to the original film in 2008. The video that I watched on the cathode ray tube monitor in Milan was first realized in 2008, but the original 1976 performance remains readable and cogent, hence the allocation of a 32-year lifespan for the piece in the brochure. As is evident, the process of demarcation, isolation, and indexing in the maze of Jonas’ work is a slippery task.<br><br>Jonas is one of the few artists I can think of whose knowledge and fascination with art history produces a relaxation of responsibilities, rather than introducing an intensification of academic or critical signifiers. Jonas’ works, often with wildly various source material at their center, willfully bleed into one another, with particular formal fixtures (automatic drawing, certain camera movements, conical forms) creating a malleable grammar that is shared by Jonas with those who care to look consistently. There is a degree of abandon to how Jonas mobilizes her own material, always privileging the evocative and structural purpose of each work.<br><br><i>Street Scene</i> is instructional in this respect, a microcosmic document that features in two of Jonas’ major projects, and subsequently sequenced in at least four distinct iterations of these two works. As such, it creates a connective point of assembly between how Jonas addresses the conditions of performance (the depicted actions of Jonas and Steir), film (their documentation), video (the editorial execution), and installation (its physical configuration).<br><br><i>“When we look at art history, we look at the Renaissance, we look at the 15th century. We don\'t look at, like, 1484 and 1494 as being that different. And if you look at the \'70s, the \'80s, and the \'90s, there are all kinds of overlaps and continuities.”</i> (3)<br><br>The recurrence of <i>Street Scene</i> points to Jonas’ willingness to mine and remodel these images afresh, according to the needs of a given project or environment. Let\'s remember that the performance itself already contains a number of elements that persist in other areas and works in Jonas’ oeuvre: women performers, cone-like sculptures, the folklore of the nursery rhyme, mystical ground (Wall Street), improvisational actions. In Milan, <i>Street Scene</i> was presented by itself - it is certainly a compelling work when shown independently - and its inclusion was described in the brochure as being:<br><br><i>“...a reference to and evocation of Reading Dante”</i> (4)<br><br>So in spite of its being exhibited independently, Street Scene actually stood as a conduit to a much larger work of Jonas’, the remaining material of which was entirely absent from Hangar Bicocca’s colossal galleries. Jonas seems to actively pursue a temporal collapse between phases of her own activity as an artist. By insisting on <i>Street Scene</i>’s value as an instrument, as well as a record, Jonas can construct an internal play of relations within her own arc of work, one that parallels the generative engine of affect present in her earliest artistic endeavors: the feedback loop.<br><br>The work of Joan Jonas is inextricable from the technologies that she has continually experimented with and through. Perhaps we could understand this appetite to apply ideas through new equipment and software as a process that lends direction for each new project. It is surely no coincidence, then, that Jonas counters the improvisational risk of new creative tools with a desire to tune into the pulse of material that was shot long ago. Jonas looks backwards with new means and in doing so creates simultaneous fabulations of time that twist into focus through the perceptual presence and inclinations of each individual viewer.<br><br>Notes:<br><br>(1) Scan from <i>Light Time Tales</i>, exhibition catalogue, Hangar Bicocca, Milan, 2014<br><br>(2) \"Joan Jonas by Karin Schneider\", <i>Bomb Magazine</i>: http://bombmagazine.org/article/3521/joan-jonas<br><br>(3) Joan Jonas interview with RH Quaytman, <i>Interview Magazine</i>: http://www.interviewmagazine.com/art/joan-jonas#_<br><br>(4) <i>Light Time Tales</i>, exhibition catalogue, Hangar Bicocca, Milan, 2014, p.26',''),(482,1,'2017-07-20 03:49:14','2017-07-25 01:26:45',NULL,'<i>EPILOGUE: YOGAFLOGOGO</i>\r\nby Olivia Mole, Ranu Mukherjee, and Jacqueline Francis',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'epilogue-yogaflogogo-by-olivia-mole-ranu-mukherjee-and-jacqueline-francis',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',_binary 'In its entirety, YOGAFLOGOGO is live action and animated video, sculpture, drawing, and performance—summoned to negotiate the tensions between imagination and the material body.<br><br>The “plot”: two girls are in a house where the television only plays static. Polly Propylene and Polly Ethylene try to get the TV to work: they bang on it, and they enact elaborate rituals and wield powerful objects to activate it. All of this doesn’t make the TV work, but their failed attempts and palpable acts of boredom create a form of language. Later on, the Pollys play a game that makes reference to witch hunts, the period of transition from feudalism to capitalism, and the narratives of women and colonized people around the 16th century. The girls perform a spell combining new languages, and it makes the TV work. The TV contains an oracle—a fitness guru with a clairvoyant ass—but, initially, her messages are unreadable. Eventually, they are interpreted, and a new form of human is released. However, for Polly Ethylene and Polly Propylene, there’s a price to pay.<br><br>In YOGAFLOGOGO, television acts as a site of exchange between inside and outside. Olivia Mole considers philosopher Luce Irigaray’s re-description of Plato’s Cave as “specular hystera” with a “screen that subtracts, divides and defends, sends back phantasmatic offspring by projection—as remainders, over and above—onto the screen that reproduces and multiplies.” Yet YOGAFLOGOGO is not so much about TV itself as about mediation, experience, body, voice, and performance. TV is a mirroring/screening/framing, too.<br><br>Early in her career, Joan Jonas wrote: “Video is a device extending the boundaries of my interior dialogue to include the audience. The perception is of a double reality: me as image and as performer. I think of the work in terms of imagist poetry; disparate elements juxtaposed…alchemy.”<br><br>While Jonas’s approach is rooted in a structural relationship to tele-visual communication, YOGAFLOGO is about the medium as an externalization of societal anxiety and excess. Mole’s YOGAFLOGOGO television set, like the one in Steven Spielberg’s Poltergeist (1982), embodies conductibility—slime and static—mediating the transgression between this world<br>and a world of representation, what film studies scholar Linda Badley calls “a black hole in the text of the symbolic order.”<br><br>-------------------------------------------------<br><br>Olivia Mole was born in London in 1975. For over a decade, she worked in the mainstream film and animation industry, designing sets for John Frankenheimer, Michael Radford, Wes Anderson, and Dreamworks Animation. She attended The Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art at Oxford University and received an MA in Production Design from the National Film and Television School in the UK. Having recently returned to art practice, Mole has shown her work guerrilla style in her own garage, and at Steven Wolf Fine Arts in San Francisco and Southern Exposure. She lives in San Francisco.<br><br>But this cave is already, and <i>ipso facto</i>, a speculum. An inner space of reflection. Polished, and polishing, fake offspring. Opening, enlarging, contriving the scene of representation, the world<br>of representation.<br>…<br>A margin outside inscription which like a star both guides and at the same time strikes to the ground, frames and freezes all forms of replicas, all possible relation between the forms of replicas.

Ravishing anything which has yet to be targeted and measured. Or which seems that way, at least. The projection screen is a mirage that conceals the part played by the mirrors that have always already produced and framed it “as such.” Thus accounts for the fact that they all remain motionless in the enclosure, fixed in the being–prisoners attitude they have been cast for, <i>frozen</i> by the effects of symmetry that they do not realize are directing this theater of remembrance. The prison that holds is the illusion that they evocation and repetition (of origin) are equivalent. They sit riveted by fascination of what they see opposite.<br>By the semblance of what is apparently taking place behind and by its projection which, by pretending to be immediate presence, presentation, steals the economy of both before and after the fact. Foils the interaction of relationships between repetition and representation, or reproduction, and perverts its prescriptions and balances. The end, the unrepresentable Idea, guarantees that replicas and copies are engendered and conform, and the fiction of the being–present masks the ancestry of its reproduction–production, with repetition left over and to spare. Time, space–time are side-tracked by a symmetrical process ordering representation elsewhere, or correlatively, are seduced, captivated, caught, in the lustrous glow of the Idea, of the sun.<br><br>—Luce Irigiray, “Plato’s Hystera” in <i>Speculum of the Other Woman</i> (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1985), 255-56.',''),(483,1,'2017-07-20 03:52:29','2017-07-21 03:40:38',NULL,'<i>The First Time I Became Another</i>\r\nby Susan Gevirtz & Jeanne C.

Where in her work do the overlaps and distinctions between different kinds of storytelling eclipse, displace, or become one another? As Jonas says, for her, <br><i>performance is not straight illustrative story telling. It’s manipulating the narrative in different ways.</i> (2) <br><br>What is this distinction?<br><br>We are always in the realm of interpretation with any artist’s work and any retelling of story. But Jonas’s interpretations are never linear—although she works with texts that may have linear plots. <i>Manipulation</i> comes from <i>manipule</i>, “handful” (a pharmacists’ measure), from Latin <i>manipulus</i>, “handful, sheaf, bundle,” from <i>manus</i>, hand. It includes a sense of “skillful handling of objects,” extended to “handling of persons.” In emphasizing <i>manipulation</i>, then, Jonas calls our attention to the hand and the handling of persons and objects as opposed to the illustrating of a story’s moral or any other fixed meaning.<br><br>In the realm of narrative, we could think of this deliberate intention—to manipulate in a nonlinear fashion instead of to illustrate—as a focus on <i>telling</i>, since telling is the tool or hand of story. Jonas’s work can be seen as a telling about telling itself. Telling is handled by being told and told about, in order to highlight performance as a scene of the inescapable collision of tellings and being told in which we all circulate. We see this in the repetitive drawing in chalk that Jonas performs in many of her videos, the camera following her moving hand. She does not draw conclusions, plot, or content. She draws drawing, just as she tells telling. Chalk is easily erasable with the side of a hand, just as any version of telling that she enacts may be replaced by another version.<br><br>Yet this is not to suggest that Jonas uses content randomly. We are given, for example, very precise ways to think about Helen in Jonas’s use of <i>H.D.’s Helen in Egypt</i> (1961) in <i>Lines in the Sand</i> (2002). Jonas makes a new Helen via her handling and rearrangement of fragments, including content, props, location, her own body, and the bodies of others. Both telling and being told about, traversing the inside and outside of her performances, she confounds the inside and outside of the story, the storyteller and the act of telling. Thus interpretation is as much a material in Jonas’s hands as is video, costume, or gesture.<br><br>It could also be said that all art making is manipulation. But not all makers wish to show us— in fact to foreground—the manipulation they are up to. Jonas calls us to watch ourselves as audience watching, to watch her ”skillful handling” showing us the seams—but perhaps at the same time, enacting a sleight of hand. She enchants, that is manipulates us. But not only us. She too is perhaps manipulated. In the realm of such cultural texts as history, fairytale, epic poetry, “The old enchantment holds,” to quote H.D.<br><br>Jonas helps us think about this when she says:<br><i>I have to interpret them [stories]. It’s something that I’ve dealt with a lot over the years: how stories have come down to us in fragmented forms….I’m very interested in how stories are retold, of course. That’s what we do—we retell stories.</i> (3)<br><br>Jonas eats the story, digests, broadcasts it through bullhorn cones to those who can’t hear, talks it to someone else who may run with it, pours hydrochloric acid on it and gives it to someone else as fake gold, sometimes a pipe is just a pipe, sometimes a shadow is a real shadow, sometimes drawing is a telling gesture: the drawing of blood, the drawing of lines in the sand, the drawing up of water. Jonas serves up to us her version of story as to us a Medusa’s head on a platter. She cannot and does not wish to report on it directly.…as Kathleen Fraser says in <i>Something (even human voices)</i>: <br><i>I do not wish to report on Medusa directly, this variation of her writhing. After she gave that voice a shape, it was the trajectory itself in which she found her words floundering and pulling apart. Sometimes we want to talk to someone who can’t hear us. Sometimes we’re too far away. So is a shadow a real shadow.</i> (4)<br><br>Or…as Richard Foreman and Tirza Latimer say in<br><i>Nothing (like human memory):<br>you understand<br>but instead variation<br>—like a broken self, multiple voices,<br>and in those cracks systems of knowledge<br>the wind of real things at last, through a radio—<br>invisible but touching distance<br>I re-imagine a world entire,<br>living the rest of my life forgetful,<br>asleep, deadpan, death of the unconscious.

Hall\'s interest in narrative is<br><i>not only…the unfolding of events in the sense of<br>a story, but more importantly, a temporality that<br>flows and takes the viewer along with it—like a<br>leaf fallen into a river, moving at a speed that’s<br>determined by the current.</i> (6)<br><br><i>In the beginning there was a river.</i><br>writes Ben Okri:<br><i>The river became a road and the road branched<br>out into the whole world.

We feared the<br>heartlessness of human beings, all of whom are<br>born blind, few of whom ever learn to see.</i> (7)<br><br>Assuming numerous forms like a river, Jonas helps us, the blind, not looking forward to being born but already having been, to learn to see<br><i>language, which is visual, become(s) woven into<br>the total form or text of the piece so it’s no longer<br>separated. </i> (8)<br><br>So Jonas writes with objects and draws our attention with chalk to the animate world in which the language, objects, and motions of a composition are all becoming one another, “no longer separated.”<br>She says:<br><i>The first time I became another was when I<br>created the persona of the erotic seductress<br>Organic Honey, through which I followed the<br>process of my own theatricality. Then I entered<br>into various fairy tales and played the female<br>characters. I really entered into those characters.</i> (9)<br><br>As performer, listener, and viewer, Jonas has repeatedly and simultaneously become another and watched that becoming. Her hand in the frame in the video <i>Street Scene with Chalk</i> (1976/2008/2010), for instance, is a “tell” of her making and interpreting presence. In much of her work, she moves about the stage performing a watching that is interpreting, or a giving of the body as a theatrical sign of interpretation. By entering into and playing the female characters in various fairytales, Jonas proposes by enactment that the most radical feminist action is to not stay still—not to identify exclusively as the erotic seductress Organic Honey, or as the missing Helen, or as a stationary anyone or thing. To refuse stable identification as any singular gender or character or genre or animal: sometimes a shadow is a real shadow, sometimes a fairytale is a real history and a real history is a narrative text or an epic poem, but never is a girl a real girl. <br><i>We could assume numerous forms. Many of us were birds.

A gesture has for me the same weight as a drawing: draw, erase, draw, erase—memory erased.”</i>–Joan Jonas (1)<br><br>In the complex ecosystem of Joan Jonas’s work, drawings hold a particularly precarious place. They appear, on the one hand, to be symbolic, archetypal, and auratic, and, simultaneously, we read them as banal, deadpan, and even haphazard. The interpolation of hand-drawn images into the technological realm of video complicates an easy reading of their meaning. Most of the time, in fact, the viewer experiences her drawings in motion. They have either been videotaped during their production—that is, drawn for the camera<br> —or, in a live performance, they are layering onto, interacting with, and interrupting a projected video. They rarely exist as finished “objects” in the gallery for extended contemplation.<br><br>If the viewer perceives her drawings to be elusive, Jonas redoubles this sense by distancing herself from facility, using prostheses like long sticks with chalk or charcoal attached to the ends. In <i>Ice Drawing</i> (2011), we watch Jonas draw handfuls of ice cubes over puddles of dark ink, subtly manipulating the two materials as they interact with and adjust to each other. The ice becomes inky, the ink is diluted, and the artist’s fingertips darken with stains. In works like this, the aleatory, improvisational character of drawing comes to the foreground.<br><br>Alternately, drawing can appear in her work as a ritualized practice, repeated over and over again until proficiency is achieved, or overcome. In <i>Mirage</i> (1976), Jonas stands at a blackboard making basic, geometric drawings: a circle becomes sun and moon, and a triangle becomes a pyramid. When the drawing is complete, she erases it and starts anew.<br><br>Most of the time, the figures Jonas draws are straightforward: primary forms, elements of a human face, the head of a dog, or the body of a fish. The simplicity of Jonas’s drawing lexicon, however, belies the significance of its role in her project. Through drawing, the juxtaposition of the hand-made and the machine-made create a palpable tension in her work, opening up a space between the human and the technological, between factura and factory, between nearness and distance. In <i>Organic Honey’s Vertical Roll</i> (1973), Jonas’s drawing is mediated by a monitor: she watches the outcome of what she is drawing not on the paper itself, but on a screen. The viewer completes the circuit when watching her performance of the drawing on a monitor in the gallery. If drawing had traditionally been the marker of the presence of the artist, here we have no paper trail to follow, only a video that loops us around again, and again.<br><br><i>“A lot of what I do is trying to choose subjects that<br>are basically invisible things you can see through.<br>There is not quite enough there to satisfy you,<br>so you look for something else, so maybe instead<br>you look for what happens between things, or<br>why these things are connected together. ”<br>—Paul Sietsema</i><br><br>Paul Sietsema is an artist whose drawings and 16 mm films explore the mediated and conditional nature of representation with deceptive simplicity. The everyday objects explored in his films are sculptures created by hand for the express purpose of being filmed. The objects are straightforward and obvious, such that one does not doubt their veracity. However, they often present a paradox about the nature of art’s facture and reception, one central to the discourse of photography and film: the objects seen on screen were often consumed in the process of their filming.

He delays and drags them out, inserting knots and contradictions. His enemy is the image: it’s too disembodied, too convincing, and too plastic. It instantly flattens three dimensions into two and makes the world into a picture. Price works to prevent objects and ideas from settling into the comfort zone of the image.<br><br>Price is particularly wary of the digital, because that’s one of those places images go to get comfortable. So he adds bulk to his images, loading them up with material, redundancy, and echo. He <i>re-processes</i> them — redigitizing the already-digitized, resampling the already-sampled, reformatting the already-formatted, redistributing the already-distributed, redistorting the already-distorted. Images go from being flat to being tough.<br><br>In Price’s work, the synthetic is both the form as well as the subject of critique: it’s art that incorporates and reflects back on its own ingredients. <br><br> [image2]<br><br>Before we get started with Price, let’s not forget all of what we\'ve already digested. Artists like Andy Warhol and Sherrie Levine, for example, helped establish that <i>surface is everything</i>, <i>pictures represent representations</i>, and so on.  We don’t need art to re-diagnose or re-illustrate that all over again, but to ask, <i>What now? Where do we go from here?</i> <br> <br><i>When the tendency is for everything to open out in all directions at all times</i>, Price tells us, <i>the problem is trying to establish a meaningful relationship between any two things</i>. If the “digital” has led to a crisis of meaning — where all can be packaged, mediated, filtered, and altered at any time — the question, moving forward, is how can art survive it?<br><br>[image3]<br><br>Price started off by avoiding the image and visual art altogether. He wrote short stories and made music instead. But he eventually took the plunge and began thinking about how to put some distance between art and the image — how to extract some freedom from all the rampant instrumentalization. <br><br>Price was born in 1973, and it shows. Those born a couple decades earlier were hesitant, at least at first, about using the Internet. Those born a couple decades later, on the other hand, never knew a world without Photoshop and therefore don’t understand how an image could ever be a fixed and inflexible thing. Price was young enough to dive deep into technology’s new tools and languages but old enough to recognize what they were doing to the nature of information. He wasn’t blind to the fact that the Internet is far from being the utopia some make it out to be. It, too, can be shut down by iron fists or filtered by corporate greed.<br><br>[image4]<br><br>And Price recognizes that he, too, inevitably risks settling into being a processed image — the cool and successful white male artist from New York.  So he re-profiles his own profile by titling one of his shows Steh Pirce or by writing a novel about a cool and successful white male artist from New York, called <i>Fuck Seth Price</i>. Via spelling and via fiction, he re-processes his own image so that it gets messier and more textured, becoming an amalgamation of honesty, dishonesty, invention, confession, power, and vulnerability. <i>Fuck Seth Price</i>, along with his many other written works, doesn’t spell out his position but experiments with it, like poetry. Are they written with sincerity or with duplicity? <i>I like them both</i>, he says, casting doubt on his own validity, like an act of self-sabotage. Or, just as likely, like an act of camouflage. <br><br>That said, Price doesn’t skip over the hypocrisy and admits that <i>taking distance from the market is so much easier when the market supports you</i>. <br><br>[image5]<br><br>You can pick up his novel at your local bookstore, find it on Amazon, or download a PDF from the artist’s website. At the bookshop, you can chat with Jim, the friendly face behind the counter, about neighborhood gossip or new arrivals, and he might slip a letter-pressed bookmark in your bag on your way out. On Amazon, you log in, notice the discount, click buy, and move on to something else.  Distribution channels each have their pros and cons. <br><br>In 2002, Price published <i>Dispersion</i>, which many have mistaken not only as an art historical essay, but as an argument <i>in favor</i> of fluidity and flow. But it’s a piece of public sculpture, an artwork that uses and reformats some of the forms that exist in the public realm — namely that of the published art historical essay and the tools and mechanisms of public circulation.  Distribution is not the same as dispersion, mind you: the former is about increasing accessibility and saturating a market, whereas the latter is about spreading information out across several markets, making it, in fact, harder to access, claim, and control. Spotify <i>distributes</i> music files, while torrent sites <i>disperse</i> them. The former is a business, the latter is punk.<br><br>[image6]<br><br>Seth Price pits information against itself by dispatching it down a range of competing, overlapping, but also often incompatible channels: art, music, fashion, design, literature, poetry, persona, criticality, formalism, commercialism, politics. <i>My work is impure and self-contradicting</i>.<br><br>Choose an image, or any digital file. Make it material by forcing it to inhabit a genre that it can adapt to, but make it one that is still somewhat foreign and will require some disfiguration. Give it the look and feel of a luxury good, a CD, a calendar, or a line of clothing. Each comes with (and demands) its own set of existing materialities, economies, rituals, distribution networks, and built-in styles — and each offers different meanings and opportunities for use and misuse.  <br><br><i>Paint your subjectivity into it</i>, he says.<br><br>But no matter what he makes, Price is well aware that by the time he’s done, the image or reference he began with will have already moved on and morphed into something else. That’s another way art can keep some distance from the digital and its images: it can exist as a ruin or a souvenir. Not <i>insta-</i>, but automatically out of date.<br><br>[image7]<br><br>In this act of re-routing or reformatting, to paraphrase the artist/critic/gallerist John Kelsey, resolution is lost and gained, value escalates and plummets, legibility and accessibility fluctuate. The file is not what matters — it’s what you and others do to it, and the contamination that happens along the way that matters. Aesthetic, ethical, economical, and political wires will be crossed, and the knots will expose something about how those wires work and why they’re configured the way they are. All will be visible in the material. <br> <br>Some artists make work “about” the codes of mass culture, but Price’s critique goes further by activating and perverting those codes <i>as form</i>. He re-processes those codes by weighing them down in material and by broadcasting them through different kinds of channels — and ensures that images don’t get too digital and too available.

In his book <i>The No Texts</i>, the painter Steven Parrino wrote about the ruthless pursuit of freedom via destruction. He tried to save painting by blacking it out, by canceling its image. He saw the job of the artist as that of being an exposed nerve—a mirror to a world that has become the site of endless distortions. FTW.<br><br>The philosopher <a href=\"http://www.andrewculp.org/\" target=\'new\'>Andrew Culp</a> extends that anarchism into politics: <i>the lesson to be drawn is that negation is finding a way to say “no” to those who tell us to take the world as it is.</i>  Today, he tells us, that world is dominated by communication, connection, transmission, and translation. And those who determine how that works and who that benefits are committing acts of violence and information warfare. The only way to fight them is not to contradict or even to accelerate, but to contaminate and interrupt. Creation and destruction go hand in hand—it all depends on what side you’re on.<br><br>In this lecture, Culp uses Jean-Luc Godard and Jean-Henri Roger’s 1969 Dziga Vertov Group agitprop film <i>British Sounds</i> (aka <i>See You at Mao)</i> as a way to think about what agitprop might look like today. Would it be enough to replace the film’s famous 10-minute tracking shot of an automobile assembly line with a similar shot at an Amazon Fulfillment Center? Or maybe the whole repertoire of jump cuts, didactic monologue, and striking color are no longer techniques of agitation in our world of pervasive advertising, informatized production, sprawling commodity chains, increasingly-synthetic life, and digital communication networks.

Thanks to years of neoliberal pessimism and Clintonite cynicism we tend to see politics as a contest over crumbs, even though there are so many of us, and the things that we need – shelter, medicine, living wages, freedom from state violence, progress towards abolition of the carceral state and the racial caste system – are both just and attainable. The good news is that Bernie Sanders, Occupy, and Black Lives Matter have showed us how to reject a bankrupt liberalism, with the result that people under 30 seem as likely to be socialists as liberals. This has a lot to do with their options in this economy, and it’s helped by social media, which has punctured the Clinton-era political spectacle traditionally abetted by the press. But social media also exacerbates the sense of futility. People on the left want to be more politically active but the forms on offer seem inadequate, so everyone spends excessive time online despite experiencing it as toxic and unproductive. Self-defeating fury is Twitter’s fuel source, from the president on down. Fury can be productive, of course.

He could not even say with any certainty whether the incomprehensible architecture around him was solid, or merely a series of delicately interlaced projections. Far off, he thought he could detect faint curvatures of enormous extent receding into a roseate obscurity.<br><br>Alone upon the massive dais, he gazed with resignation at the audience arrayed before him like a dark, heaving sea that had frozen into a collection of byzantine shapes. A handful among them, he could see, more or less resembled the people of his own time, though this fact brought him little comfort, for he knew that this resemblance was merely a kind of costume, an appearance which the people of this period changed as effortlessly and casually as he would a t-shirt or hairstyle. Yet despite the raw strangeness of the crowd, the appalling gulfs of time that separated their sensibilities from his, he thought he recognized in them the complacent arrogance that always emanated from those in positions of great power and affluence. He watched them murmur amongst themselves, their jewel-like bodies sleek and untroubled, except perhaps by their own terrible desires. <br><br>He understood as well that, though he looked more or less like “himself,” this too was only a matter of surfaces and external topologies. Though outwardly, the visage in the mirror seemed to be the one he remembered (albeit somehow <i>smoother</i>), the internal arrangements of the vessel he now—temporarily—occupied were quite different from what he had been used to when he had enjoyed a biological existence. Apparently, it was not deemed necessary that his host’s body be made over entirely in order to house his consciousness; indeed, one of the Directors had told him, quite casually, that his host was not even what he would have described as male. Though not precisely <i>female </i> either, for in this world, biology itself was a matter of recombinatory play, continually subject to humanity’s endless capacity for caprice. The initial realization of how radically different his host’s <i>actual</i> physiology was from his own had come as a vertiginously horrifying shock at first (though he realized that this horror was shot through with bright threads of an excitement he reluctantly acknowledged as erotic). But all too soon, both these reactions had deliquesced into numb fatigue, and from there into an all-too familiar boredom. <br><br>He suspected, not for the first time, that he brooded too much. For a brief moment, he felt that old, fleeting feeling of an outward expansion: his mind was racing, grasping at far-flung ideas. The core of the wonder tradition, he recalled reading somewhere, was travels, chronicles, encyclopedias; that is to say, surveillance for the sake of knowledge. Magic and sorcery had always used the most advanced technologies at hand; this was well-known. In the Bronze Age it may have been fire, fur, bone, blood, metal. In the Middle Ages it was the crucible and alembic, the chalk circles and potions of the alchemist or the diviner. In his day it had been television, cell phones, the Internet. These were what was used to control people. In this current world in which he found himself, however, such stage tricks had become unnecessary; technology had truly become a magic circle through which the citizens of this age had passed, never to return. They had joined the dead, or at least the non-living. <br><br>Idly, he found himself wondering what his host was like, what sort of appearance they typically wore, when not cloaked in the form of someone who had been dead for millennia. He knew that to be a vessel for a construct such as himself was considered a deep honor; moreover, there were only a handful of individuals who possessed the necessary synaptic adaptability to be imprinted in such a manner without serious or lasting impairment. And of course there was the issue of cost; he knew the Foundation demanded an exorbitant price for these retrievals and imprintings. It was apparently a complicated matter to thoroughly convince a sentient mind that it was someone else, even if only temporarily.<br><br>You can only understand something by fighting it, he mused, but what if that something was yourself? Aside from being an exhausting proposition, wouldn’t the very act of that engagement change you, thereby changing the nature of the very thing you hoped to reveal through the conflict? This had always been a problem, this perpetual slipping away of himself from himself…unbidden, his mind filled with images of endlessly receding hallways, empty waiting rooms, the sunless voids between the stars. These were not new thoughts, but then there had been no new thoughts for a very long time, for him or anyone else. Everything had already been said and done; all that was left was to keep the pieces moving around on the board, to keep up appearances. To show you were still trying, he supposed. Hence his presence here; hence the hothouse appearance of the audience, who suggested nothing so much as a museum full of Max Ernst paintings come to life. <i>How much longer could all this continue? </i> For a moment, he considered the possible forms the last stages of life in the universe might take, before heat death overtook everything completely. He imagined flattened, rugose beings like living carpets, their surface area maximized to absorb heat, scuttling in darkness across the cooling surface of a dying star, shrunken and shriveled, its fires almost out. <br><br>For him, the worst realization of all had been that he would not retain any of this, not now, nor the next time, nor the next, nor the next. No new information, no new <i>experience</i>, could be allowed to “corrupt” his imprint; each time his pattern was generated anew from the n-dimensional space in which it was stored, it was always instantiated from its default state before being mapped onto the consciousness of the host. It could not be added to without fundamentally altering it—which of course would render it worthless. He understood, with a sense of irony almost oceanic in extent, that he was essentially a kind of priceless artifact, a unique edition. The idea of allowing his pattern to change, to evolve, was as unthinkable to these people as allowing someone to scribble notes on the first Gutenberg Bible would have been to the archivists of his own time.<br><br>He ought to have fed himself before he came here, he realized. Though he knew the body he currently occupied was supposed to be physiologically incapable of such unpalatable sensations, he felt both listless and unsettled, as though his body was composed of a mass of uniform particles held together by an envelope of static. Why was he here? Why had they called his shade forth yet again from its quantum underworld, reweaving the pattern of his consciousness out of its imperceptible fluctuations? What could they still want from him? What could he tell them that he had not said already, innumerable times before?<br><br>He saw now that the inability of his construct to evolve beyond its original parameters was in fact mirrored by the stagnancy of this shining, post-scarcity society. They, like him, had stopped a long time ago. Here, there could never be anything genuinely new, for everything had already been imagined, every possibility realized. It was a world of stasis disguised as one of endless change. All that was left was to keep shuffling the cards, to keep up appearances.<br><br>At any rate, he had no regrets, nor any desire to extend his time here beyond this final absurd performance in which he was yet again forced to play the straight man. The brief time he had spent here had been more than enough; he did not need to see anymore. He would welcome the oblivion of non-existence when it came; he only hoped that that it would be the last time, though he knew it would not.<br><br>It hardly mattered; he would remember nothing of this. The impassive, coral-like face of Director Ossua flickered into his field of vision and nodded; it was time to begin. He turned again towards the audience and began to speak.<br><br><i>History as a narrative of progress points to the future, and History as a memory or memorial points to the past.

This condition has emerged partially because of the dissolution of an avant-garde vis-à-vis the end of Modernism, precipitating a new kind of relationship with time that privileges constant accessibility to everything, a kind of forever present. Today, who is interested in “making it new,” pushing it forward? Who and what are the avant-garde? And, if they exist, which culture are they pushing forward or reacting against? How does an avant-garde get ahead of a continual present that has no desire to differentiate among cultures?<a name=\"9b\"></a><a href=\"#9\"> (9)</a><br><br><u>Capital Cities, <i>Safe and Sound</i>, 2011</u> <a name=\"10b\"></a><a href=\"#10\">(10)</a><br><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rWZr2F0qohA?rel=0&showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" gesture=\"media\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><br>The free speech crowd certainly does know how to speak, and their central success has been publishing articles that reinforce the idea that antifa scares away allies and emboldens the right. These pundits clearly do speak for a segment of the population, and it\'s possible that black bloc outfits and videos of street fighting⎯touted incessantly by right-wing media⎯are turning them away from the antifascist cause. The more alienated these observers feel, the more correct they consider themselves in condemning antifa. But antifa isn\'t trying to earn the support of 51 percent of any electorate.

He’s like a data assemblage. He’s a collection of everything that made him, but he can’t get beyond it. He’s relieved when he’s erased. Whatever the artist does will be eclipsed by the technology of the form. The construct becomes a prison.

What’s happened is a general decline of the United States of America. Expanding to fill the political space is the looming specter of a New Europe, the European Union, one nation under an odd blend of Info-capitalism and creaking socialism, a shadow stretching across the globe. And behind this cloak of might lurks the endless ocean of China, which, with the help of the Europeans, has leapt from its twentieth century grind of industrializing poverty straight into the 21st century’s digital economy, of course at the expense of millions, just as she had done with her Great Wall, centuries before. China, the rough but sturdy lad, a bit dumb but ravenous and determined, joins hands with the aging but vicious grand dame, she who has seen the bloom of her beauty turn into a decrepit travesty… It is a dangerous allegiance. <br><br>But this is not the only fateful pairing. The United States sees the military/industrial complex grow to encompass the entertainment industry. To the accompaniment of crushing heavy metal and orgiastic holographic display, fans will see what they can comfortably assume are staged deaths, but which they know on some level might be the real executions of political prisoners. For America in those dark days was a malignantly tolerant nation⎯the secular humanist state pushed to the nth degree⎯a Godless country where every belief was encouraged except the narrow notion that there is a God, one God, and his son Jesus Christ. Christian prayer was not allowed, while the children of Druids, Afrocentrists, Queer Nation, and others were allowed to practice their bizarre rituals in the name of diversity. All copyright will be outlawed then, because information is clearly a free entity⎯as endorsed by the cities of virtual people, descendants of our modern-day hackers, who have coded their minds into strips of magnetic binary data and passed on, in a mockery of the Rapture⎯their first computer transcendent called Enoch thereafter. A realm of bodiless beliefless people, a true socialist society, invisible and omnipresent. <a name=\"20b\"></a><a href=\"#1\">(20)</a><br><br>American culture, he mused, rested on a kind of fundamental folklore, which had something to do with infinite mutability and the interchangeability of all things. This manifested in some obvious ways that supported the ideological framework of a free-market democracy, e.g., that a “virgin” territory could be hewn and shaped into a mighty nation through work and discipline; that the citizens of that nation were equal, none better than any other; and that a poor man here might transform himself into a wealthy man. It was apparent also in less obvious ways, for instance in a comic strip about a man who became a spider, which itself became a TV show, and thence a movie, from which someone made a play and a musical, plus lunch boxes, dolls, and video games; or the fact that Joe Schmoe could become a pop star, and then an actor, and then an entrepreneur with a line of clothes, perfume, or furniture. But surely art was different? <a name=\"21b\"></a><a href=\"#21\">(21)</a><br><br>[image4] <a name=\"22b\"></a><a href=\"#22\">(22)</a><br><br>When you start out as a young American, he thought, it’s all about open doors.<a name=\"23b\"></a> <a href=\"#23\">(23)</a><br><br>Disclosure: my firm represents interests in the fossil fuel industry. <a name=\"24b\"></a><a href=\"#24\">(24)</a><br><br>Choose an image, or any digital file.

Has society become increasingly numb to the appearance of politically-engaged art because of the prevalence of these kinds of amalgams in visual culture? Whereas consumers once purchased material goods⎯desired so badly through those storefront windows⎯in order to create an identity, now they operate by way of another kind of window⎯the screen⎯using social media and the Internet to project their identity digitally into the public sphere. The photographic image today is a circulating, marketable commodity where individuals (that’s us) are both producers and consumers, all in service to these corporations. We are working for Instagram and Facebook with eventual devastating consequences to the fabric of our society. We should take urgent note of that. <br><br>So, where is the critique when our knowledge and experience of the vast intersections of commodity, media, and politics are too sophisticated to easily generate a pause in the conflations of images of mass consumerism and antiwar protests? <a name=\"32b\"></a><a href=\"#32\">(32)</a><br><br>I guess we haven’t gotten to the central question we argued about. <a name=\"33b\"></a><a href=\"#33\">(33)</a><br><br>If the “digital” has led to a crisis of meaning⎯where all can be packaged, mediated, filtered, and altered at any time⎯the question, moving forward, is how can art survive it? <a name=\"34b\"></a><a href=\"#34\">(34)</a><br><br>Annie Dorsen now makes “algorithmic theater.” In her latest piece we sit inside a rubber pop-up planetarium inside a theater in Midtown, staring up at fake stars, a fake universe that is part of the “real” universe.

The show, which garnered him an <i>Artforum</i> cover and inclusion in that year’s Whitney Biennial consisted of a book, printed wall works on metal, and flat wall sculptures in laminated wood and painted aluminum. It was his first show, that I am aware of, that did not include film or video. A simple press release provided the process by which the wall works were made. Pasted at the top of the release was an image of a drawing; two hands, sleeved in a flouncy dress shirt, engaged in the formation of a shadow play character. (1)<br><br>The exhibition consisted of eleven works, including the book <i>How to Disappear in America.</i>(2)   Four pieces, described as ink on Dibond, are composed of elements that appear at first to be rhombuses of gold aluminum on which variations of a dancing figure have been printed in different colors. Upon further looking, a relaxation of the eye creates, through negative space recognition, a set of alternative images: variations of a hand passing a key to another.(3)  A larger piece, again on Dibond, appears first as an abstract map of countries or continents outlined in spray paint,  before snapping into an image of a woman kissing a man delineated by the negative space of the wall.(4) But wait a second more and your mind changes again. The man’s face isn’t really positioned correctly for a kiss. Maybe a kiss on the cheek, but the lift of the woman’s chin suggests that she is just as likely whispering in his ear. Other mappings, all constructed of laminated rare wood veneers, depict: a couple singing a duet; a diptych of a person lighting another’s cigarette and a boy bowing his head as he passes something to an older man; a diptych of a hand with a pen pointing to a contract where a signature is required by another and a hand spooning food into another’s mouth;(5)  a triptych of a woman breastfeeding a baby, a priest presenting communion to a man, and a hand dropping money into a shamed beggar’s cup; and the silhouette of an older couple, again either kissing or passing a secret, paired with a small framed drawing of two hands mingled in the same manner as the image from the press release, this time creating the profile of a jackass.(6)  The ambiguity resulting from the positive/negative space reading of this work allows the viewer some room to determine meaning, specifically within the artifacted borders of Price’s engagement with the appropriation of mass commerce. <br><br>[image2]<br><br>Tim Griffin’s analysis of Price’s work as retro advancement through strategic retreat in his 2009 article “The Personal Effects of Seth Price” and David Joselit’s framing of Price’s work within an epistemology of search in his article “What To Do With Pictures?” (2011) are both thoughtful readings of Price’s output up to this point. In both cases they focus on his use <i>of effects</i> to create temporal and spatial holes to be filled by the viewer. While both address the affinity with forms of commodified distribution and capitalist flows that this device implies, neither locates the kernel of Price’s project there, preferring instead the formal and conceptual maneuvers at which this work excels. This presents an opportunity that I wish to explore, as this work emerged at a precise and extreme moment in our cultural and technological history.(7)  <br><br>In his application of the term \"effects\" to Price’s work, Griffin analyzes the video sculpture <i>Digital Video Effects: “Spills”</i> (2004)—a work which takes as its substrate archival footage by Joan Jonas of Robert Smithson and Richard Serra arguing with art dealer Joseph Helman about the fancy prices afforded late abstract expressionist painting—to present two prescient points. First he suggests that for a young artist emerging into “an unprecedented boom in the market for contemporary art,” Serra’s statement that “most of our young artists are just ripped off at a very early age” and Smithson’s insistence that “nobody has the right to legislate or judge what I’m doing” must have had both a sobering and empowering effect. Griffin goes on to suggest that while Price seems to agree with his predecessors, he does so “only while underscoring a sense of inevitability around the objects of Smithson’s scorn.” If Smithson’s project was one of transcendent evasion and removal, Price instead attempts an infiltration, “performing a disappearing act of his own, perhaps, but only in the fashion of a purloined letter.”(8) <br><br>Joselit focuses not on Smithson but Serra, suggesting that his 1967-68 list of verbs—to roll, to crease, to drop, etc.—could be repurposed and applied to “the behavior of pictures within digital economies.” He offers three categories for Price’s “‘procedures of formatting”: “to disperse,” “to profile,” and “of effects.” At the end of the section discussing this third category, Joselit makes an interesting observation:<br><br><blockquote>A contemporary art devoted to circulation, is, of course, a creature of a specific ecology: the market. But instead of either giving up or selling out, Price, like more and more artists, games the market by surfing it. (9)</blockquote><br><br>What we read in both Griffin’s and Joselit’s evaluation of Price’s work is a position that seems to conform to models of dispersed subjectivity and affirmationist acceleration, both prevalent in theory and art criticism of that moment.(10)  Within this affirmationist mode creative agency is reduced to, at best, strategies of rupture through mimetic exacerbation, and at worse an uncomfortable consonance with a nostalgic, dynamic, and unfettered global capital of real abstractions.(11)   On this point, Polly Staple, in her review of Price’s 2008 exhibition at Kunsthalle Zurich, makes it plain, insisting that, “Critical discourse blends easily with aesthetic productivity, a fairly voracious but straightforwardly aspirational tale of free-market capitalism and cannibalism. This is what it means to choose to participate.”(12)  Indeed, within Price’s own writing there is an expressed comfort, even admiration, for capitalism’s distributive capacity at the level of desire. But when it comes to Price, it is never so simple, as he writes in <i>Dispersion</i>, quoting <i>The Rosarium Philosophorum</i>:<br><br>“Where we have spoken openly we have actually said nothing. But where we have written something in code and in pictures, we have concealed the truth…”(13) <br><br>[image3]<br><br>With this in mind, we may attempt a negative space reading of Price’s wall sculptures, not as images of dispersed subjectivity mapped through abstraction, or as a surrender of agency to the forces of affirmation, but instead as “the redemptive circulation of allegory through design”;(14)  artifacts of resistance to the hegemony of real abstractions revealed through moments of human relation. In this mode Price’s work is not a trace of absence, but of <i>spirit. Spirit. Spirit</i>; a holey decor secreted within real abstractions’ most abstract and opaque signifier. Coded as figures of metastability, these objects oscillate between states of meaning. A ghost <i>and</i> the shell, until the eye lands and the mind decides. How these small amounts of randomness expand, not only within real abstractions but also within art, culture, and politics reveals itself as a problem of consciousness persistent within the realm of effects. The lake of our feeling is the lumber of life. And no one wants to be the jackass.<br><br>.+*<br><br><i>Over the years, Drew Heitzler has been an artist, a gallerist, a curator, a writer, an experimental filmmaker, a director of animated shorts, a graduate lecturer, a cinematographer, a bar owner, an amateur motorcycle mechanic, and a pretty good surfer.

Indeed a quick Internet image search of “hand shadows” reveals that the character in question is an African “boy” from a hand shadow play called The Crocodile Man. The selection of this image as an introduction to this show is intriguing but remains a mystery. Perhaps a nod to Barack Obama, the first dark-skinned president of the United States, the multiethnic progeny of European and African heritage, who had been inaugurated just a month before the exhibition opened?<br><br>(2)<i>How to Disappear in America</i> is an edited collection of appropriated texts detailing instructions for going on the lam, purloined from various online and analog sources and reprinted as a hard-bound book by Seth Price.<br><br>(3) In his video lecture piece <i>Redistribution</i> (2007—ongoing), Price gives us a look at the file from which one of these images was taken and we learn that the key is being passed, at least in the example presented, from a male to a female. This image also appears on the cover of <i>How to Disappear in America.</i><br><br>(4) Price’s use of abstracted maps in this exhibition bring to mind Jean Baudrillard’s analysis of Jorge Luis Borges’ use of cartography in <i>On Exactitude in Science</i> as a representation of simulation preceding and insinuating the real.<br><br>(5) Again in <i>Redistribution</i>, we are offered a look at the digital image from which the silhouette is formed over a map of the United States. A man in a shirt and tie is playfully force-fed a piece of cake, an event common at wedding receptions. In the negative space silhouette of the finished work, the aggression of the act is palpable, but not the playfulness. Coupled with the ominous tone of the pointing finger in the contract signing, the work carries within its relations a rather threatening tone. Only after clues delivered later, in <i>Redistribution</i>, may we understand the piece as artifacts of matrimony, an occasion of joy. But even this joy is left disrupted, in this case by the choice of depicting contract and ceremonial submission, relations of which Leopold von Sacher-Masoch would certainly approve. Translatory oscillation is in full effect here.<br><br>(6) But there is an intriguing difference here: While the top hand in the drawing is outlined but left empty, revealing the white of the paper, the bottom hand is penciled in, darkened, as if it were its own shadow. The one and the other here become two halves of the same body. A mysterious image once again, which in the context of the exhibition brings to mind the paradox of Buridan\'s ass; a hypothetical situation in which a donkey that is equally hungry and thirsty is placed precisely midway between a stack of hay and a pail of water, and since the ass always goes to whichever is closer, it dies of both hunger and thirst.  A version of this situation in digital electronics is described as metastability, in which a small amount of randomness acts as a tie-breaker, and the circuits settle into one state or the other.<br><br>(7) By 2008 the world wide financial crisis of 2007, dubbed the Great Recession, had really taken hold. The derivatives market had collapsed, as had insurance and mortgage markets. Financialized capital, already under constraints by new banking regulations enacted after 9/11 to stem the flow of terrorist financing, was now even more desperate for both tax shelters and opaque points of trade. As we have seen over the last decade, cash based real estate and the art market, often intermingled, provided an ideal solution. Interesting then that 2008 also marked the year that <i>Frieze</i>, once a magazine of art criticism but by then mostly a circus tent of art commerce, took on as its sponsor Deutsche Bank (now infamous as the premier site for Russian money laundering and the only bank that will still do business with the Trump organization). Also by 2008, the iPhone, introduced the previous year, made hand held computers globally ubiquitous, and Facebook, which was opened to public access in 2006, had turned online social networking into the dominant site of information exchange.<br><br>(8) <i>The Purloined Letter</i> is a Victorian era short story by Edgar Allan Poe, the third of his three detective stories featuring the fictional C. Auguste Dupin, and considered an important early forerunner of the modern detective story. More significantly, the story was central to an ongoing debate between Jacques Lacan and Jacques Derrida on whether a proper translation of meaning was achieved by a structuralist or deconstructive reading of the text. As we shall see, translatory oscillation is central to Price’s work.<br><br>(9) I would contend that this metaphor of surfing which often appears in analyses of accelerationist theory, networked communications, and relational aesthetics betrays a vital misunderstanding of not only surfing but also of that which constitutes a surfable wave. This, however, is a topic for another essay.<br><br>(10) Accelerationism, having infiltrated post-‘68 cultural production and social thinking, was contested by advanced art through critical attacks on both object and subject, until events initiated by the abandonment of Bretton Woods in ’71 and then exacerbated by the collapse of ’89 made this position untenable. In its weakened state, art took a turn toward the transcendent as a mode of resistance. But this renewed critique of institutions was quickly absorbed into a convivial aesthetics of relations operating on a global scale, mostly unsatisfying even in its antagonistic form. The election of 2000 followed quickly by the attacks of 9/11, the War on Terror, and the ascendency of neoconservative and neoliberal policies at home, abroad, and within the art world, would only heighten the mood of leftist retreat into which Price was emerging as an artist.<br><br>(11) I borrow the term “mimetic exacerbation” from Hal Foster, who asserts in his recent book <i>Bad New Days: Art, Criticism, Emergency</i> (2015) that this is the most potent form of critique employed by recent advanced art, though he concedes that it is a dangerous game, easily capable of sliding into forms consonant with that which it critiques.<br><br>(12) Polly Staple, “The Producer,” <i>Frieze</i> 118 (Oct. 2018).<br><br>(13) This 16th-century alchemical treatise published in 1550 includes a series of 20 woodcuts in which the hermetic androgyne is prevalent, understood as an allegory of Mary, Jesus, God, and the Holy Spirit.<br><br>(14) Seth Price, <i>Dispersion</i>, 2002.<br>',''),(537,1,'2017-12-21 02:27:17','2018-01-24 01:53:21',NULL,'<i>Hiding in Plain Sight:  Seth Priceâ€™s \"The World\"</i>\r\nby Dodie Bellamy and Kevin Killian\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'hiding-in-plain-sight-seth-pricea-s-the-world-by-dodie-bellamy-and-kevin-killian',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',_binary 'Seth Price’s poetry is all about occlusion—from wrapping a gallery’s walls with a thousand-foot Mylar strip, to vacuum-sealing objects, to displaying barely legible wooden silhouette cut-outs, to producing a book called <i>How to Disappear in America. </i>Repeatedly, Price murks the divide between packaging and art. At dOCUMENTA (13) the lining of the clothing he exhibited were patterned with corporate logos and visual static copied from the insides of security envelopes, both camouflaging and engulfing the wearer. His relationship to the viewer can feel aggressive in its drive to destabilize and confront. With his work, we’ve gone through the same arc for the past ten months:  befuddlement, followed by grudging appreciation, followed by deeply personal response. It’s as if, subliminally, Price’s art has infected our psyches. Beyond their cool surface, Price’s projects operate upon libidinal economies. From the <i>Folklore U.S.</i> press release: “I’m Going to the Post Orifice: Seth Price.”<br><br>From Dodie’s journal, the day after the first meeting of our Seth Price study group at the Wattis:<br><br><blockquote>The trees on 11th Street are slated to be cut down. To mark them, they’ve wrapped the trunks with foot-and-a-half-wide strips of plastic. Like the plastic they wrap boxes in for shipping. Like the plastic they wrapped the boxes of our archives with when they were sent off to Yale. Over their striated sheen people have attached decorations—a flower to one—around another is tied a red ribbon with a note attached beneath it. It’s addressed to Omar, the guy whose remains were found nearby in a suitcase. A body, like the tree, unsuitably wrapped. The note reads, “2015. Omar, May God keep you in His loving care. Forever loved and missed.” Thinking how Seth Price wrapped the walls of a gallery with a long strip of packaging plastic—and his lamination of objects—his calling into question what is figure, what is frame. What is packaging, what object. This disconcerting blurring of distinct categories. The trees are contained and marked and girded. Since their death is announced, the plastic has the resonances of an embalming. The plastic embalms them.</blockquote><br><br>One of Kevin’s publishers, The Song Cave, makes a fair amount of its budget by selling editions of artists they know. In the fall of 2016 we saw that there was going to be a drastic price cut in its Seth Price piece. Usually $300,<i> The World </i>(2014) was going to be half price for Christmas. (This in itself set the tone for dozens of lame jokes about the coincidence of this artist having the word “price” right in his name—there seemed no way around it. “Half Price,” then, was the name of the game back in December, when we bought ourselves this Price drawing.) In practical terms, our search for meaning in Price became sharply reduced to this one artwork, and as we have sat through all prior presentations, we were always on the game for those that would allow us to understand this drawing better, and this paper will bring up many of them, one by one, sometimes in clumps.<br><br>[image1]<br><br><i>The World</i> itself—the print edition from The Song Cave—divided us instantly. Kevin was enamored from the start, and it was he who wrote the check. Dodie found the piece uninteresting. The repeated heads of this retro-looking woman seemed no more than decorative patterning, perhaps reflecting the corporatized designs lining Price’s envelopes and fashion line. But as soon as the disruption of the patterning became apparent, she couldn’t stop looking, couldn’t stop interpreting. We began feverish speculation: Who is the subject of the image? The repeated woman, or the woman who’s hiding in the hat of the multiple woman? Is that a sly look on the hidden woman’s face, or is she sleeping? Is this about a fracturing of one glamorous woman, or are these supposed to be different women, hinting at the conformities enforced by fashion and style? The glamorous woman whose hat has been colonized suddenly appears to have hands. But the hands don’t look human. Her top hand looks like a goose’s head, the bottom a wing, suggesting some sort of animality. Again, what is the subject of this drawing: the replicated woman or the disruption? Is <i>The World</i> about mutancy or rebellion? The similarity in shape between the glam woman’s decapitated head and Mick Jagger’s wrapped head on the cover of the <i>Goats Head Soup</i> album adds another layer of creepy. Price’s patterning here suggests camouflage, but it is impossible for us to decide if the patterning is about irrational excess or protection. Attending the class session on Price’s book <i>How to Disappear in America</i>, we learned that it is a survival manual copied from online advice that is out of date and therefore useless in actually helping someone disappear. From this point of view the book becomes a sad, desperate fantasy. Price frequently confronts human intensities in an affectless manner, a move that’s either brilliant or eye-roll inducing, depending on the viewer.<br><br>[image2]<br><br>In the middle of our year studying Price we were invited to curate an exhibition at the beleaguered di Rosa Foundation in Napa Valley [now the di Rosa Center for Contemporary Art], a “raid the icebox” sort of show that allowed us access to the 1800 works of art collected by the late Rene di Rosa from 1950 through 2010—work largely made by artists of Northern California, work of a maddeningly excited range of quality. As the year began we assumed that our work there would have nothing to do with the Price trail, but we couldn’t keep the two life paths apart. They began to merge almost from the start. The curators at di Rosa, interested in keeping their museum <i>au courant</i>, asked us to shape our show into one that reflected museum interest in themes of social justice and political edge. We decided to look at work that paired display with secrecy, and many of the key works in our show dwell on surveillance and camouflage.<br><br>Camouflage has long had links to artists and naturalists; a century ago the painter Abbott Handerson Thayer of the Hudson Valley was brought by the Allies to the battlefields of WWI to test his then-controversial theories of natural animal markings. He propounded, for example, that birds were often white, blue, or yellow to blend in with the sky, while snakes and badgers grew earth colors on their backs, and fish grew translucent. He and his team of surveyors argued against then-standard use of solid color, say, khaki uniforms, urging instead the use of camouflage in disruptive patterns to evade detection from the air or from fifty yards away on foot. Today’s dissidents have adopted the lessons of Thayer—from donning masks and face bandannas at protests, to painting their faces in geometric patterns to evade all-seeing surveillance cameras—to disrupt exposure.<br><br>[image3]<br><br>As we learned, many of Price’s works and texts enact such disruption or say they do), and when we opened this drawing we saw pretty much a textbook case of optical illusion, and that’s the portal to full-blown camouflage. <i>The World</i> soon came to remind us of the duck-rabbit illusion that Wittgenstein wrote about so eloquently, and then of the drawing of the same era in which a young woman is shown regarding herself in a circular mirror, but when you look again, the beauty and her reflection seem like vacant eye sockets as the vanity mirror turns into an enormous skull. Both works were created in 1892—<i>All is Vanity</i> by an 18-year-old Scottish artist called Charles Allan Gilbert, and the duck-rabbit conundrum by an anonymous illustrator for a German humor magazine. Perhaps power relations began to resemble one another in the dawning age of Freud, and so the numbers of visible objects seemed to compress in response—1892 was the year the diesel compression engine was invented, and the year in which Thayer began to preach the gospel of obliterative coloration. He studied the ways in which animals and plants sought to mimic the coloration around them, and, to avoid predation, hid themselves in nature in paradoxical, even nutty, countershading displays.<br><br>[image4]<br><br>We speculate that in <i>The World</i>, Price is quoting from the German duck-rabbit illusion: look more closely at the disruptive woman’s hands. Soon enough you’ll see, as we did, that it’s not a hand, it’s a masterstroke of eye-foolery. Similarly the woman’s face in the hat poses those same Wittgensteinian questions—Is it a woman, or is it a hat? In <i>How to Disappear in America</i>, references to hats abound. “Wear a hat... everywhere. Ha ha ha  Yes indeed. Hat’s [sic] hide the face from cameras. Most cameras are higher than your head. Spend a lot of time looking at the counter. Or your shoes.” Hats equal hiding in plain sight.<br><br>Thayer and his family were great friends of William James, the American philosopher and pragmatist, and James apprenticed his two sons to study under Thayer as the artist began an expansion of his painting factory on a vast scale. As the First World War approached, a number of artists and military theorists began to converge at Thayer’s work, and the art of camouflage blossomed. Armies of men, clad in multicolored patterns, oblique as snakes, dizzied background and foreground. Thayer toured Britain and France on the battlefields with his dioramas, with the sponsorship of John Singer Sargent and Teddy Roosevelt. And, as we know, his eccentric theories won out. Did they save lives? Or did they make war easier to wage?<br><br>[image5]<br><br>Camouflage conceals by confusing figure and ground. Price’s wooden laminated silhouettes—e.g. <i>Secret </i>and <i>Lighting </i> (both 2008)—at first appear as abstract maps, but soon vision flips, and both hands and profiles emerge from the gallery walls in what previously had been white space. What are we looking at, and is it looking back at us? In this light, we watch the peacocks roaming the lawns of di Rosa--their real eyes small and barely alert, but when they spread their tails, eyes of startling beauty and sexual refinement stare at us with a seductive Darwinism. The “night has a thousand eyes,” wrote Cornell Woolrich, the midcentury horror writer, speaking of the stars that know our future above. But at di Rosa, feathered eyes preen and sashay down the stairs and through the dirt paths even when the sun is out.<br><br>[image6]<br><br>French sociologist Roger Caillois (1913-1978) questioned the value of camouflage and mimicry, finding in them, instead, a dangerous and compelling excess. For Caillois, the form of an organism always exceeds its survival needs, and an organism’s tendency to mimic its environment emerges from an instinctual desire to lose itself in space. In her essay “Animal Sex: Libido as Desire and Death,” Elizabeth Grosz explores the eroticism of such excess:<br><br><blockquote>Erotic desire . . . is a mode of surface contact with things and substances, with a world, that engenders and induces transformations, intensifications, a becoming something other. Not simply a rise and fall, a waxing and waning, but movement, processes, transmutations. That is what constitutes the appeal and power of desire, its capacity to shake up, rearrange, reorganize the body’s forms and sensations, to make the subject and body as such dissolve into something else, something other than what they are habitually. (1)</blockquote><br><br>What is hat. What is woman. What is human animal figure ground. Members of our research group say they don’t find Price’s work sexy, but we see an eroticism in Price’s drive towards copying, illusion, reframing, collage, generation loss. Instead of meaning we get “movement, processes, transmutations,” a libidinal impulse to dissolve and rearrange the outside/other/self. Even Abbott Thayer’s project to dematerialize animals into speckled grasses and reeds is starting to feel compulsive and exorbitant, leaving in its wake what Caillois termed “irrational residue.”<br><br>[image7]<br><br>Seth Price calls his drawing <i>The World</i>, and that struck us, as it was perhaps supposed to. It’s such a large thing to say about something so simple on the one hand, and so old-fashioned on the other. In Napa, when the fires raged, we worried first about our art show—now postponed to January 29, 2018—and then about the flock of peacocks that roams the place, outlasting their master. They seemed like the dumbest birds in the world—but their excessive coloration allowed them to survive anything, for they had long ago joined the ranks of the immune. The most colorful and eye-catching specimens of the animal kingdom were, as Abbott Thayer painted them, indistinguishable from their surroundings. They have disappeared in America—or onto a canvas even larger and more diverse, the world.<br><br>.+*<br><br><i>Kevin Killian’s recent books include two books of poetry, </i>Tony Greene Era <i>and </i>Tweaky Village<i>, from Wonder Books, the third volume of his </i>Selected Amazon Reviews<i> (Essay Press) edited by Dia Felix, and </i>Tagged: Variations on a Theme<i>, Killian’s intimate photographs of poets, artists, painters, musicians, and filmmakers naked, or nearly so.

This elision allows it to fall through the cracks and become fragmented in a complicated way. <i>Title Variable</i> is amateur while remaining professional, exists online while physically printed, and is distributed in various audio formats. It is a mixed-media artwork based on material that becomes “just content,” foregrounding the process of how material is given meaning. <br><br>In <i>Title Variable</i>, Price cites the goal of talking about music, youth, subculture, subversion, and nostalgia in a distanced way. He creates a series of audio compilations, concentrating on pivotal but vague moments in musical history. These compilations are packaged and released in various formats, some with alternative titles. Available in museum bookstores, record shops, or online, some comps are inexpensive, while others have been produced for collectors as limited-edition art objects. To accompany them, Price writes essays that are published in various magazines and range greatly in style and voice. Although he mentions not wanting to link <i>Title Variable</i> to any specific musical genre, Price creates many overt associations; in the following text, I lay out a timeline that fills in some of the holes created in <i>Title Variable</i>’s wake.<br><br>From the 1970s into the 1980s, Progressive-Rock musicians released successful synthesizer-led instrumental albums. These records helped influence the emergence of New Wave and other subgenres such as Synth-Pop, Post-Punk, No Wave, and Techno. The Punk phenomenon of the 1970s created a challenge to the monopoly of established recording studios, giving young performers the confidence to record and go live with relatively unpolished acts.  <br><br>The Punk subculture emerged in the United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States in the mid-1970s. Exactly which region originated Punk has long been a matter of controversy. In the late 1970s, the subculture began to diversify, which led to the proliferation of factions such as Oi!, 2 Tone, New Wave, Post-Punk, and Hardcore. The Punk subculture influenced other underground styles, such as Alternative, Indie Rock, Crossover, Thrash, Queercore, and extreme subgenres of Heavy Metal. <br><br>Punk bands typically produced short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and aggressive singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often, political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraced a DIY ethic; many bands self-produced recordings and distributed them through informal channels, i.e. cassette exchange. Price often refers to the Punk period as protest music, comparing punks to hippies.<br><br>New Wave differs from Punk as it displays characteristics common to pop music, rather than the more \"artsy\" Post-Punk. Although New Wave incorporates much of the original Punk sound and ethos, it exhibits greater complexity in both music and lyrics. Common characteristics of New Wave music include choppy rhythm guitars with fast tempos and synthesizers. Vocals sound jittery, high-pitched, and erratic. While gathering commercial success, New Wave artists created an aesthetic that had a slight bend towards the future.  <br><br>Post-Punk, originally called New Musick, emerged from the Punk movement; artists departed from the traditional Garage Rock template of Punk to pursue a variety of radical sensibilities. Emboldened by Punk\'s energy, but determined to break from Rock cliché and subvert conventions, Post-Punk artists experimented with sources such as electronic music, black dance styles, Jamaican Dub, and the Avant-Garde, as well as recording technologies and new production techniques. <br><br>No Wave, a parallel to Post-Punk, was a short-lived Avant-Garde scene that emerged in the late 1970s in downtown New York City. The term \"No Wave\" was a pun based on the rejection of commercial New Wave. No Wave probably also was inspired by French New Wave pioneer Claude Chabrol, with his remark, \"<i>There are no waves, only the ocean.</i>\"(1)  No Wave music presented a negative and nihilistic world-view, rejecting the recycling of traditional Rock aesthetics, such as Blues-Rock and Chuck Berry-style guitar riffs in Punk and New Wave music. Various groups drew on, or explored, such disparate styles as Funk, Free-Jazz, Disco, and the Avant-Garde.<br><br>The No Wave movement lasted a relatively short time, but it profoundly influenced the development of independent film, fashion, and visual art. This music, especially in the original releases, generally had a DIY aesthetic in the genre\'s original production era of cassette tapes (mentioned because almost everything has been re-released on vinyl). Many of these emerging artists composed in their bedrooms and garages and then distributed works through cassette exchanges, bypassing the major vinyl producers and giving rise to the cassette culture of the 1980’s. <br><br>Filmmakers Coleen Fitzgibbon and Alan Moore created a short film in 1978 (finished in 2009) of a No Wave show benefiting X Magazine that documents performances by DNA, James Chance and the Contortions, and Boris Policeband. Shot in black and white Super 8 and edited on video, the film was exhibited in 2013 at Salon 94. These genres—Post-Punk, No Wave, and later Minimal Wave—incorporated new technologies, including cheaper synthesizers, leading to the popular expansion of electronic music styles. <br><br>The wider availability of synthesizers and digital programming was a radical change for a younger generation of artists and musicians, who could suddenly explore in ways that previously had been available only to academics. In Redistribution, Price mentions 18-year-olds having access to this equipment: “<i>But it wasn’t really until a bit later that samplers became cheap enough for 18-year-olds without a lot of resources, and that’s when you really start to get all the experimental musics of the period: techno, the spread of rap, etc.</i>”<br><br> [image2]<br><br>In the 1980s pop and dance music made heavy use of synthesizers, facilitated by invention of the relatively inexpensive, mass-market Yamaha digital DX7. The DX7 synthesizer swept through popular music, leading to the adoption and development of digital synthesizers in many forms, as well as to the rapid decline of analog synthesizer technology. <br><br>The Roland TB-303, Roland TR-808, and Roland TR-909 synthesizers were heavily used in the production of early Acid House, Techno, and Hip Hop dance tracks. The 909 was one of the first Roland instruments to be equipped with MIDI, linking it to a computer, which controlled the drum pads, sequencers, etc. Many dance records were released as white-label promos or LP test pressings before becoming commercial pressings. Some of these LPs would never see the commercial light of day, causing them to receive a fetishized status, as artists sold these white-label LPs without any packaging. In <i>Title Variable</i>, Price talks about not wanting his musical releases to have any specific packaging—a move that echoes the already commonplace behavior in his community.<br><br>The use of synthesizers, drum machines, and grassroots distribution methods helped fuel underground techno genres such as Gabber, Jungle, Breakcore, and Splattercore—some of which crossed over into commercial success. Hardcore dance tracks typically included samples and synthesized melodies, with the tempo generally ranging from 150 to 190 ppm (very fast!). During this time period things seem to be speeding forward rapidly; this is the highway toward the Internet.<br><br>Gabber, also know as Gabber House, is a Dutch style of electronic music. Although a House variant from Detroit (cited as the birthplace of techno), Gabber reached Amsterdam in the 1980s, and it was Dutch producers and DJs who evolved it into the harder house variant that is today known as Gabber. The essence of this early Hardcore sound is a distorted bass drum sample, overdriven to the point of becoming clipped into a distorted square-wave and making a recognizably melodic tone. Often the Roland Alpha Juno synthesizer, or the kick from a Roland TR-909, was used to create this sound, and lyrics were frequently screamed, pitch-shifted and distorted, and later, computer-generated. <br><br>As Price explores in his work, many of these pre-Internet sounds also bridge into post-Internet music. Analog sounds recorded and collected on cassette, vinyl, and compact disk are later transferred and catalogued onto the web using P2P file-sharing platforms such as Napster, Limewire, Kazaa, and Soulseek, only to become further physically recollected and re-released back onto vinyl and cassette. Current musical sound, production, and distribution are constantly reaching back into history in order to move forward. Maybe the past keeps coming back because the present cannot be remembered?<br><br>[image3]<br><br>In conclusion, I’m not sure the Price compilations or the accompanying Price essays are “good,” at least in terms of listening. I’m also not sure how to contextualize the information I have laid out here in terms of a contemporary timeframe. Is this timeline just doing the same thing Price is doing in his musical projects—trying to talk about a past that was formative to us in some way? It seems to me that we could continue on and on, commenting on artists and production techniques that have changed the way we look at and listen to audio information and the culture that surrounds it. <br><br>Artists today are making music in new ways that are specific to the moment. Young artists and listeners have online communities that support and sustain online labels, giving the artists working within these networks freedom to create, record, share, and maintain multiple projects under the same or alternative titles, without ever having to create a physical product. We live in a time when young artists upload and immediately receive millions of plays on SoundCloud. No one was counting how many times a Punk song on a cassette was played. We’re in a time when there is so much information moving at such a rapid pace that we are unable to keep track of what is…what.  <br><br>.+*<br><br><i>Bob Linder is Head Curator at The David Ireland House at <a href = \'http://500cappstreet.org/\' target= \'new\'>500 Capp Street</a>.

In his book <i>The No Texts</i>, the painter Steven Parrino wrote about the ruthless pursuit of freedom via destruction. He tried to save painting by blacking it out, by canceling its image. He saw the job of the artist as that of being an exposed nerve—a mirror to a world that has become the site of endless distortions. FTW. <br><br>The philosopher <a href=\"http://www.andrewculp.org/\" target=\'new\'>Andrew Culp</a> extends that anarchism into politics: <i>the lesson to be drawn is that negation is finding a way to say “no” to those who tell us to take the world as it is.</i>  Today, he tells us, that world is dominated by communication, connection, transmission, and translation. And those who determine how that works and who that benefits are committing acts of violence and information warfare. The only way to fight them is not to contradict or even to accelerate, but to contaminate and interrupt. Creation and destruction go hand in hand; it all depends on what side you\'re on.<br><br>In this lecture, Culp uses Jean-Luc Godard and Jean-Henri Roger’s 1969 Dziga Vertov Group agitprop film <i>British Sounds</i> (aka <i>See You at Mao)</i> as a way to think about what agitprop might look like today. Would it be enough to replace the film\'s famous 10-minute tracking shot of an automobile assembly line with a similar shot at an Amazon Fulfillment Center? Or maybe the whole repertoire of jump cuts, didactic monologue, and striking color are no longer techniques of agitation in our world of pervasive advertising, informatized production, sprawling commodity chains, increasingly synthetic life, and digital communication networks.

(1)</blockquote><br>In the early 2000s, Seth Price began a project entitled <i>Title Variable</i> (2001–ongoing). It began with a mixtape of early video game soundtracks, <i>Game Heaven</i> (2001), continued with mixtapes of New Jack Swing, <i>NJS</i> (2003), Industrial, <i>Industrial Fist</i> (2004), early 1980s academic synthesizer music, <i>Akademisches Graffiti</i> (2005), and, in the last installment to date, an eight-hour mix of dance music, <i>8-4 9-5 10-6 11-7</i> (2007). Price wrote essays that comment upon each of the genres included in the mixes, some of which were published in music collector publications, and some in other contexts—he has specified that the work as a whole comprises the essays and the multiple forms of distribution of the music mixes (CDs, vinyl, digital). <i>Title Variable</i> addresses the influence of digital technology on culture—one of the key themes in Price’s body of work—as well as Price’s own autobiographical nostalgia, which also recurs throughout his work. <br>[image3]<br><br>Price has stated that he specifically chose music genres in <i>Title Variable</i> that were strongly influenced by changes in digital technology. In his essay for <i>Title Variable</i>, Price taxonomizes one genre: “What a time you chose to be born! The short-lived musical genre known as new Jack Swing is just old enough to be vaguely embarrassing. It hasn’t attained classic status, and may never do so.” (2) Excepting the academic synthesizer music of <i>Akademisches Graffiti</i> though, Price’s choice of musical forms may not be a strictly impartial analysis of technological change, but rather an exercise in autobiographical nostalgia: “My interest in obsolescence per se doesn’t go too far; it’s a guilty pleasure, something to do with nostalgia. But interesting things happen around the moment of obsolescence.” (3) For example, Price’s description of an Industrial concert, published as part of <i>Title Variable</i>, reads as an autobiographical narrative:<br><br><blockquote>Take Front Line Assembly in 1989 at The Roxy: the crowd all in black, with half-shaved/half-long hair, topknots, and dyed fringes, combat-boots, fashion\'s take on bondage, fey boys in eyeliner. A mawkish, unglamorous bunch, possessing little of the fashion sense of the punks, and more style than a sea of hardcore punks. Picture that sullen kid, reading Semiotext(e) or Re/Search, maybe <i>Society of the Spectacle</i>, although he swims in anti-intellectual waters, so publicly he totes books on Manson, Satanism, criminal pathology, and Nazis, in keeping with the deadpan morbidity inherited from seventies Industrial. (4)</blockquote><br>The concert described may be the October 21, 1989, Wax Trax records showcase at the Roxy in New York, headlined by Suicide, with support from Front Line Assembly and Meat Beat Manifesto. (5) It could in fact be one that Price himself attended (at age 15), making the anonymous bookish fan he describes into a nostalgic self-portrait. That interpretation would align with Price’s 2003 drawings of an Industrial fan circa 1988:<br>[image1](6)<br><br>The video-game soundtracks in <i>Game Heaven</i> correspond with Price’s late childhood and early adolescence—were they perhaps games he himself played? As for New Jack Swing—was Price an Industrial teenager who transformed into an R&B fan a few years later, or is that genre simply a time-marker? Unlike Industrial, New Jack Swing was a broadly popular genre that could designate a moment in time even for those who weren’t fans.<br><br>Of course, taking any of Price’s statements at face value is always problematic. For example, the same article describing the Front Line Assembly crowd also includes an account of a driving trip where “I even dragged my son” through northern Indiana to visit the Wax Trax records store in Chicago, listening to the “new” Revolting Cocks record <i>Big Sexy Land</i>—but that record came out in 1986, when Price was only 12 years old. The synthesizer music in <i>Akademisches Graffiti</i> was produced when Price was in early grade school, and so to the extent it would have actual nostalgic value, it would be related either to the time he first discovered that music, or to an imagined past like the fictional road trip.<br><br>The subject of nostalgia has recently become an area of copious research in the field of social psychology. (7) Not surprisingly, researchers have found music to be a fruitful area for research into feelings of nostalgia.  One seminal paper examined research subjects’ musical preferences, finding they follow a curve relating the age of the subject to the time of songs’ popularity, with preferences peaking at songs that were popular when subjects were 23.5 years old. (8) Researchers in the field have attributed a multitude of benefits to subjects’ engaging in nostalgic reminiscences, including offsetting negative mood, loneliness, feelings of meaninglessness, and existential awareness of death. Returning to music’s connection with nostalgia, researchers have also found that subjects who were given song lyrics to read that they had earlier identified as having nostalgic value subsequently scored higher on tests that aimed to measure how meaningful they felt their lives to be. (9)<br>[image5]<br><br>The phrase “What a time you chose to be born!” appears on a number of occasions in Price’s writing, first tinged with Price’s trademark ironic false earnestness, but later implying genuinely earnest nostalgic feelings about his coming-of-age. He first uses the phrase as noted above in “Journalistic Approach to New Jack Swing” (2002), and then again in <i>Dispersion</i> (2003): <br><br><blockquote>With more and more media readily available through this unruly archive, the task becomes one of packaging, producing, reframing, and distributing; a mode of production analogous not to the creation of material goods, but to the production of social contexts, using existing material. What a time you chose to  be born! (10)</blockquote><br>It then reappears in the press release for the 2005 show “Grey Flags”:<br><br><blockquote>Magic is a process that always uses the most advanced technologies at hand: in the stone age this meant fire, fur, bone, blood; in the middle ages, the crucible, the alembic, the chalk circle. Today it is images, a thickening web of images that amounts to a magic circle through which the citizens of this age have passed, never to return. What a time you chose to be born! (11)</blockquote><br>And in Price’s 2003-2005 <i>Décor Holes</i>, it becomes explicitly autobiographical: <br><br><blockquote>I once recalled someone standing by a keyboard, blurting out “I don’t know what to say!” The phrase belonged to a female character on an early Cosby show, and was spoken into a new sampling keyboard demonstrated by Stevie Wonder, who appeared as himself…A quaint memory. What a time I chose to be born! (12)</blockquote><br>The original source of the phrase appears to be the dubbed Samurai film <i>Shogun Assassin</i> (1980), probably via its sampled use in the hip hop track “Cold World” by the GZA, from the 1995 album <i>Liquid Swords</i>. (13) Importantly, the GZA’s use of the sampled dialogue situates it in a dystopian context:  <br><br><blockquote>[Intro sample from <i>Shogun Assassin</i>] <br>I had a bad dream<br>Don\'t be afraid, bad dreams are only dreams.<br>What a time you chose to be born in<br>[Hook: Life]<br>Babies crying, brothers dying, and brothers getting knocked<br>Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down<br>In this cold, cold world (14)</blockquote><br>The nature of the environmentally driven birth-trauma that Price was addressing with musical nostalgia is made precise in his 2015 book <i>Fuck Seth Price</i>. Although published as a “novel,” as Price noted in an interview, “I’ve written a novella, called <i>Fuck Seth Price</i>, that’s due out this spring.  It’s not my ‘voice’ but it’s close enough.” (15) He writes that what for an earlier generation was the most important, world-shaping event, “World War II” (as shorthand for war, genocide, state socialism, cold war, etc.), has been supplanted in the contemporary era by the advent of “the digital”:  “…our era was unable to get over the digital in exactly the way that a prior era had been unable to get over the twentieth century.” (16) And for Price, the effect of the digital era is personal; as he noted in a 2007 interview, “I’m interested in the effect of digital technologies, and they reached the marketplace sometime in the 1970s. It does happen to line up neatly with my own lifespan.” (17)<br>[image2] <br><br>Price’s broader body of work has revealed other facets of his concerns with time, as exemplified by the <i>Calendar Paintings</i> (which are actual calendars) and by his frequent use of the dates of works’ production as elements in the works themselves, such as in <i>COPYRIGHT 2006 SETH PRICE</i> (2006), itself a nostalgic evocation of the Reagan era.  Nostalgic references (from the Reagan era, to 1970s modernist playground equipment, to mid-1980s TV ads for food) abound in Price’s other video works as well. Price’s explicit “date-stamping” and nostalgia appear to be founded on a fear that “the digital,” in the form of the internet, may be eliminating time itself.  As a character states in Price’s <i>Books of Ice</i> (2016),<br><br><blockquote>She smiled. “Yes. The problem is, there’s no sense of time on the web, yes? Everything is new, bright, contemporary. So there’s no hint of decay, no static, no light-burns, but also there is no mystery. Just the present of your own monitor. No place, no time. And if you take away our sense of time, the world basically loses all meaning….” (18)</blockquote><br>In the end, <i>Title Variable</i> reveals an “intimation of one’s own mortality” in its archive of outdated technology-driven musical genres, but at the same time, it offers nostalgic comfort by re-establishing time-dependent meaning in the “personal experience of lived history.” <br><br>.+*<br><br><i>Ross Sappenfield is a writer based in San Francisco.</i><br><br>Notes:<br>(1) Seth Price, <i>Industrial Synthesis</i>, The Museum Of Modern Art: <i>Video Viewpoints</i>, May 14, 2001. <br>(2) Seth Price, “Journalistic Approach to New Jack Swing,” 2002, published on sethpricestudio.com.

Thanks to years of neoliberal pessimism and Clintonite cynicism we tend to see politics as a contest over crumbs, even though there are so many of us, and the things that we need – shelter, medicine, living wages, freedom from state violence, progress towards abolition of the carceral state and the racial caste system – are both just and attainable. The good news is that Bernie Sanders, Occupy, and Black Lives Matter have showed us how to reject a bankrupt liberalism, with the result that people under 30 seem as likely to be socialists as liberals. This has a lot to do with their options in this economy, and it’s helped by social media, which has punctured the Clinton-era political spectacle traditionally abetted by the press. But social media also exacerbates the sense of futility. People on the left want to be more politically active but the forms on offer seem inadequate, so everyone spends excessive time online despite experiencing it as toxic and unproductive. Self-defeating fury is Twitter’s fuel source, from the president on down. Fury can be productive, of course.

We had arranged to meet at noon at Parque Berrío, right in the center of Medellín. She was coming from Santa Elena, a small town located an hour away from the city, past the mountains in the East. I was coming from my hotel in the South, twenty-some minutes away from our meeting point. It took us a few minutes to find each other. I had asked the taxi driver to drop me off next to the Metro station on the corner of the big plaza. However, I felt disoriented as soon as I got out of the car and instinctively walked in the opposite direction, going under the elevated metro track and stopping next to one of the many tiny stores in the underpass. The stores were full of countless types of objects and I felt a sense of relief watching the small business owners stationed next to their merchandise, chatting with people. While standing there, under the elevated metro, I realized that I had probably avoided walking toward the large plaza because I felt intimidated by the wall of people and the numerous buses and cars continuously moving around the square. I felt I would have been absorbed by the mass, becoming invisible inside of it.<br><br>I began walking away from a shoe shop, up the steps towards the square, and called my cousin. <i>Yes! I’m here, where are you, Juana? I’m coming from the stairs, where are you? I’m next to a palm tree, I’m wearing a black cap, do you see me? No, which palm tree? Wait, I see you now… Where?  Here, here! I’m still near the staircase but don’t see you… Stay there, I’ll come to you.</i> The plaza was not particularly crowded. There were some people standing under the tall palm trees or sitting on the benches around the geometrically-shaped green areas. There were also a few people like me, wandering around, looking up, looking down, stopping for a few seconds, then looking to one side and another without seeking a precise destination. The rest were passersby walking directly through the square with the fast pace and confidence typical of those familiar with their route and not easily distracted, even if they walk by new people every day.<br><br>We hugged each other a few times. It felt great to see her familiar face and to have finally found each other in that unfamiliar but welcoming public place. On our way to lunch, she told me that the market for her artisanal products — handmade bracelets, necklaces, pins,<i> dreamcatchers </i> — had been slow this season. <i>People don’t seem to want to spend their money as soon as they get their paychecks anymore. Plus, it’s getting harder to be able to set up your “parche” on the ground and sell stuff in some public spaces. They are not allowing us to stay for that long.</i><br><br>It took me a few minutes to realize that her work as a seller of artisanal products was related to an artwork I had just been thinking about. I tried to explain it to her.<br><br><i>You know, contemporary artists sometimes work with different media and there’s this one artist in New York who has used a pretty wide range of materials, sometimes combining different objects he finds or collects and assembles together… hair, bottle caps, basketball hoops, clothing parts, photographs… I’d say his work comes from him being mostly a sculptor, he’s good at working with space and with objects in space, but he has also made two-dimensional works… for instance, he made a series of prints by putting grease and ink on his body and pressing himself onto a surface. He has also made large installations, sometimes incorporating sound. Music, and especially jazz, is important to him. One day, he had a show in New York where he left a space completely empty and dark, a commercial gallery. He only gave people those little keychains with LED lights to walk around with. He chose the ones with a blueish light. I remember my mom had one of those to find stuff inside her purse, it probably worked for her but I doubt those little keychains were able to provide much light to illuminate more than a few feet away from wherever people were standing in that big dark gallery space. I didn’t see that show but I know people who did and some of them found it arrogant and even fraudulent and others loved it and thought it was a masterpiece… those are the kinds of reactions he gets. Anyway, he has done many different things, usually unexpected, poetic, and twisted at the same time. His behavior is unpredictable too. He’s pretty well-known at this point and his work is pretty expensive too, but what I like about him is that he is his own thing, you know… It doesn’t seem that he’s interested in looking for people’s approval, quite the opposite. He’s the one who decides when to show his work, where to show it, who can buy it, under which terms someone can buy it, and when it is or is not okay to even meet him or have any type of contact with him. All that seems to be at the core of his work, that’s kind of what the work is about, deciding when to give importance or value to things; but he’s the one who decides, no one else. And, well, I must say that, in addition to being a fantastic artist, he’s also “African-American,” as they say in the US, and, as you know, the US is still pretty segregated. It’s difficult to be so direct and talk about the devastating social differences and injustices in the US these days, and it’s very hard to find people like him gaining such power and authority, being respected and leading his own game, especially in the white-dominated art world. His work incorporates elements from his own background growing up in Illinois, but I think he also incorporates things that are still part of his life, stuff he sees around him on a daily basis. I read that he likes walking a lot. Sometimes I think his work is the compilation of a world he wants to be surrounded by, which includes people, spaces, and objects but also stories (real or fantastical), situations, and memories. He’s a very private person, but I imagine “his people” aren’t necessarily only “art world people.” Sure, he deals with some of them, some pretty heavy duty ones, I’m sure, but there’s a sensibility in his work that is not so present in the world of art these days. It’s hard to explain with words, but the first thing that comes to my mind is the word freedom. His work deals with freedom in different ways. Freedom to walk, observe, and make art out of his experience of wandering around. Freedom to move in and out of the art world as he pleases and needs. Freedom to assemble or connect certain things and disconnect other ones. Freedom to make material what is abstract and abstract what is material.<br><br>Anyway, one day he made this work, a performance that a friend of his, a photographer, documented. I call it a performance now but I’m not sure if he would. It was winter and a blizzard was forecasted for that week… so he decided to go out and set up a parche on the sidewalk using a fabric or rug-like surface, similar to yours. He set it up in an area with a lot of foot-traffic in lower Manhattan, near a school called Cooper Union, and offered a series of snowballs for sale. He organized them in rows from large to small, with the largest ones set up on the back row, closest to where he was standing, and the smaller ones in the front. He made five or seven different sizes. The quantity of each size increased with the size of the snowballs. I remember seeing many large balls and just a few little ones in the photos. Talking about this piece not long ago, someone mentioned that he probably bought some type of molds to make the balls, maybe the type that you can find at a one-dollar store, but I think it´s also likely that he made each one of them with his own hands, using the snow he found around where he set up his colorful parche. It’s not clear if he sold any of them, maybe he did. I heard once that he sold one — a man bought it, someone said. But only him and his photographer friend really know. What the pictures show is that he was there against a wall, standing right behind his parche of snowballs on the sidewalk. Sometimes he appears in the pictures alone but sometimes he appears interacting with people who stopped by. Other photos show people turning around and looking at him and his merchandise. I´d assume that some of them were curious and exchanged a few words with the snowball seller. What did they talk about? It’s hard to know, but I think what matters is that they had the chance to talk. He likes that. I’ve heard he likes storytelling. And I bet he likes rumors, too.</i><br><br>My cousin followed me with a certain curiosity but with a slight look of confusion. After all, her ability to sustain herself directly depends on the sales she’s able to make, so listening to me tell her about a guy who was trying to sell snowballs on the street probably sounded pointless and ironic. I insisted that the guy was an artist, a conceptual artist, and that the snowballs were probably an excuse for him to interact with people, they were the conduit that allowed for a series of conversations or interactions he wanted to have. When I asked my cousin if she usually talks with people when she’s selling her products on the street, her eyes widened, as if she was finally hearing something that made sense and sounded familiar to her. <i>Absolutely! Talking with people is fundamental, and I think I’m good at it because people end up spending more time talking about other things, life-related stuff, and sometimes people buy even more things after we have connected through a random topic. You inevitably learn to read people through their behavior, their body language… I have a friend, an artisan too, who talks to people in a way that touches them in a special way. I’ve seen people cry just because she has said something about what she sees in them, or because she has asked a question that opens up another aspect of them. It’s amazing that this happens with random strangers on the street.</i><br><br>Then I told her that I still remember hearing people in Bogotá referring to the public areas — mostly the sidewalks — where street sellers used to sell their merchandise as “mercado del agáchese.” <i>Agáchese</i> means something like “bend down” in Spanish, it sounds like an order or a request a person gives to another. She started laughing, but then got very serious and said something like <i>well, yeah! We expect people to crouch down or, at least, to not point at things with their foot! I get so mad when they do that.</i><br><br>At that point, we realized that we had walked past the street where we were supposed to turn, so we took a few seconds to get oriented and started walking in a different direction, toward our final destination. We had so much to catch up on that our three hour-long lunch felt short when we said goodbye and hugged each other again on the street.<br><br>The taxi ride back to the hotel felt different. I kept thinking about the way my cousin described her <i>market</i> and found it incredibly beautiful and brave that she has been making her own products, has been using her body to transport and display them, and employs her voice and sensitive but clever personality to sell them to strangers she encounters every day on the street. She controls every aspect of her work. This is definitely not the experience contemporary artists usually have, I thought. I arrived to the hotel and spent the rest of the day thinking about this in relation to the artist and his snowball sale work.<br><br><i>Market</i> is an old word. Apparently, it was first invented back in the early twelfth century to describe a <i>meeting</i> scheduled at a fixed time for buying and selling products, mostly livestock and provisions. Later, the word was used to refer to the <i>physical space</i> where buyers and sellers convened (farmers markets and flea markets are examples of this today). Then, in the early seventeenth century, the invention of corporate shareholders (to issue bonds and shares of stock to the general public) began the foundation of the <i>capital market</i> that we know today. This new notion of the market became more of an abstract activity, removing the initial face-to-face interaction between people. Tangible products were replaced with speculative ones.<br><br>Selling snowballs on the street plays with all of these notions of the market. The street, as a place for encounters, is certainly a physical market, and by selling snowballs, the artist not only offered something that was not “on the market,” but created a market and a value for it. Where is its value? The price charged for the snowballs is not as relevant as the idea of them having any value at all. After it’s been purchased, would a snowball lose its value once it melts? Or would the snowball’s intangible and ephemeral value be higher when it’s gone?<br><br>Last year, a friend told me the story of Curtis Caroll, an inmate in San Quentin State Prison who taught himself to read, and then studied the stock market and its patterns while in prison. Without the use of computers or calculators, he devised a system that predicted stock fluctuations, and his portfolio, apparently, has made him a significant amount of money (he has never shared the precise amount). Without revealing the formula he invented, he says that rumors, in the end, are what have the most influence in the market. He studies the stock market based on the “stories” that appear throughout the different sections of the newspaper every day — news, gossip, scandals — and he invests his money based on the emotional weight he thinks those stories may have.<br><br>In the snowball piece, speculation and rumors play important roles as well. There’s the rumor of the weather forecast, predicting that a blizzard might come to the city the following day, as well as all the possible theories and stories about what happened and did not happen during the performance that day. The photographic documentation establishes some kind of factual foundation, but most of the story remains open to interpretation and to collective construction over time.<br><br>In that sense, I believe that the heart of this work lies in how it’s talked about. This is where it gets complicated. By letting oral history play such a dominant role, the artist points to his interest in the way broader social and economic systems assign value to things, including the system that is the art world. But he’s not only “knowledgeable” about those pre-existing systems in the sense of being a keen observer — he’s an expert at playing with them and at inventing his own.<br><br>His models are the masters of jazz: they know the theory, vocabulary, rules, history, and structure of music so well that they are able to <i>play music</i> and <i>play with music’s</i> system at the same time. When those musicians are together on stage, what gives meaning to their exchange is the tension between all that is familiar, logical, and previously known, and all that is not. Negotiation and deliberation is at the core of their dynamic — as the snowball seller knows all too well.<br><br>In this piece, snowballs are an excuse for strangers to have a conversation or a negotiation in the midst of a context where everybody is “nobody.” On the street, people are invisible, until they’re acknowledged by someone else. But the artist did more than simply provide a context for a series of casual interactions: he and his photographer friend also provided us with the illusion that we can imagine, understand, and construct the meaning of all that is not visible in the few photos that exist from that day.<br><br>[image1]<br><br><i>Juana Berrío is an independent curator and writer based in San Francisco.

In a massive volume that is both institutional critique and reference work, the artist <a href= \"/on-our-mind/andrea-fraser-is-on-our-mind-2015-2016\"> Andrea Fraser</a> documents the reported political contributions made by trustees of more than 125 art museums, representing every state in the nation, in the 2016 election cycle. With campaigning that featured attacks on vulnerable populations, the vilification of the media and “cultural elites,” and calls to curtail civil rights and liberties, the 2016 election cycle and its aftermath transformed national politics. It was also the most expensive election in American history, with over $6.4 billion raised for presidential and congressional races combined. More than half of this money came from just a few hundred people—many of whom also support cultural institutions and serve on their boards.<br><br><i>2016</i> is organized like a telephone book. Contribution data is laid out alphabetically by name of donor. With this and other data filling more than 900 pages, the book offers a material representation of scale of the interface between cultural philanthropy and campaign finance in America. It also provides an unparalleled resource for exploring the politics of the museum world. <i>2016</i> includes an introduction by Andrea Fraser elaborating on the links connecting cultural philanthropy, campaign finance, and plutocracy; a section on each museum represented; and a section including data summaries and additional data. The book presents a powerful argument that supporting the arts must involve more than giving donations to museums; it must also include defending the values, social structures, and political institutions of an open, tolerant, just, and equitable society.<br><br>The book also include an afterword by Jamie Stevens, who led the <a href= \"/on-our-mind/andrea-fraser-is-on-our-mind-2015-2016\">year-long season</a> at the Wattis about and around Andrea Fraser\'s work (2015-2016).

Hiring <i>Some Proximity</i> (2014) involves an art critic and two dancers: in this service, the critic visits nearby exhibitions and makes critical observations and notes on what he or she sees, which are then choreographically interpreted though the voices and movements of the dancers. <i>Some Riding</i> (2015), on the other hand, doesn\'t reflect its context but reflects itself. You\'d be hiring two dancers to read two essays about embodiment and performance economies, as they ride the cadence of the text with dancerly punctuation. In <i>Some Strands of Support</i> (2016), two dancers can be hired to perform haircare on a suitably upright sculpture or statue. Finally, hiring <i>Dare to Keep Kids Off Naturalism</i> (2017), the fifth and most ambitious choreographic service, would mean that four performers use elaborate costumes with modular forms to create ever-changing ornamental, fictional or dramatic scenarios. <br><br>To hire any of these services would come with the cost of paying an hourly wage for it. <br><br>The Wattis Institute has hired all five services, giving an overview of Adam Linder’s singular approach to dance and performance.

The perennial popularity of fictional sorcerers like Harry Potter and the “Charmed” sisters aside, <i>actual</i> magic has, beginning in the Middle Ages and continuing on through the Enlightenment, acquired a reputation as something frivolous at best and grounds for grievous bodily persecution at worst—certainly something unworthy of consideration by the serious mind, and perhaps most egregious of all, <i>ineffectual</i>, at least in the view of modern values. <br><br>Those of you already nervously eyeing the exits can relax; it’s not the intention to make a case here for or against the possible efficacy of magic with a capital M. One wonders, however, if the inveterate distaste of contemporary rationalists (which in some ways includes all of us, if only by default) for an enterprise like magic might have something to do with the discipline’s traditionally poor showing in the area of repeatability (by which of course we mean <i>reliability of consistent</i> outcomes), a value much prized by the many among us possessing a more bottom-line-oriented mindset. <br><br>Accordingly, we’ve gradually grown accustomed to framing magic and technology as oppositional modalities, when in fact magic, from the very beginning, has always been a <i>form</i> of technology (perhaps even its earliest), albeit one that tends to be more unreliable and idiosyncratic, and thus difficult to scale for the market. But magic and technology have always shared an essentially identical teleology: the imposition of human will and desire onto external realities—hopefully, with as much efficiency and as little work as possible. What is a <i>spell</i> if not a kind of cheat code intended to override some feature of the reality game engine, a fragment of the <i>logos</i> that gives all things form?<br><br>Magic and technology also share something else: a long habit of trying to hide their efforts, shunting expenditures of energy, labor, and resources offstage and out of sight. (This is especially true of technology under capitalism.) We say something happens “as if by magic” to express an apparent absence of friction between intention and outcome. An occurrence mediated by magic supposedly requires virtually no effort beyond the expression of a desire that it should occur. On the classic TV series “Bewitched,” everyone’s favorite suburban sorceress Samantha merely needed to wrinkle her nose to bend recalcitrant reality to her will; over on the competing show <i>I Dream of Jeannie</i>, Jeannie had to work a bit harder to get things done, being required to cross her arms and blink <i>simultaneously</i> (beware of drunk wish-granting!). Wizards wave wands; witches cast spells. It all looks so easy.  <br><br>Science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke’s endlessly-quoted observation that “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic” reflects this deeply inscribed conception of magic as an essentially frictionless enterprise. And certainly modern technology continually (and increasingly vocally) strives for this appearance of frictionlessness, at least at the user level. Today’s product and UI design seems to want to make us all feel like our own eldritch mages, wielding glowing talismans that respond to our desires at a single touch or spoken command (and soon, possibly by thought alone.)<br><br>The truth is less appealing, as truths usually are, which is that magic, like pretty much everything else, involves an enormous amount of hard, tedious work. Anyone who has ever performed even a cursory investigation of magic as a discipline—whether in the provinces of fiction or as an actual human practice extending back over thousands of years—soon realizes that behind that wave of the wand lie years of arduous training: of the will, of the body, and especially of the mind, which must be crammed full of knowledge regarding the mystical properties of thousands of substances—everything from plain old rosemary to such dire objects as the Hand of Glory. The memory must be stuffed to bursting with countless incantations and spells, along with the knowledge of <i>exactly</i> where to place what stresses on which syllables—lest a spell for turning water into wine instead wind up summoning an unpleasant relative back from the grave. <br><br>On close examination, it turns out that, even in the realms of the Occult, there’s still no such thing as a free lunch.<br><br>Similarly, today’s gleaming devices hide almost inconceivably vast systems of production and exploitation behind slick their UIs. Dig down into the actual systems and materials in your phone, your computer, your flat screen, or even your toaster, and you will begin to discover layer upon layer of patents going back over decades, complex webs of licensing involving dozens of different companies, and networks of material extraction and fabrication that reach into every corner of the globe, and which almost always involve the brutal extraction of both human labor and natural resources at multiple nodes. <br><br>The increasing sophistication of today’s software conceals layers of code of which, at this point, no single human individual can claim complete knowledge. Beneath the Photoshop clone stamp that miraculously zaps away a blemish on the face of Rihanna lies tens of thousands of hours of laborious coding. Meanwhile, the seemingly effortless gesture of sending a text, the invisible backing up of your phone’s photos to the cloud—increasingly the work of various AI systems, modernity’s answer to Prospero’s Caliban and Ariel—all involve very real expenditures of energy and resources that, conveniently for our consciences, take place far away from our immediate awareness or consideration.<br><br>In light of this, it’s worthwhile to briefly reconsider the word occult, which really just means hidden or secret. In its most fundamental sense then, the term would seem to apply as much to the intrinsic conditions of current technology as it would to the colorful practices outlined in classic grimoires such as <i>The Lesser Key of Solomon</i>—rendering the abilities and activities of entities like Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg no less arcane, in their essence, than those of a Voldemort or Sauron (and possibly far more so when you think about it, given that Sauron’s data-collection system was pretty much limited to one big floating eyeball.)<br><br>In the end, the absence of friction is always an illusion. But of course, the production of illusions has always one of the most potent and useful forms of magic. And what is denial if not a particularly obdurate type of illusion?<br><br>In the form of occult practice known as Ceremonial Magic, which involves the summoning up of various mid-level demonic beings to do one’s bidding, the practitioner learns early on that there is always a price to be paid for any transaction—a price whose <i>full</i> extent may not be revealed until much later. This is summed up in one of magic’s most basic edicts, which is always ignored at one’s peril: Never summon what you cannot put down.<br><br>In other words, beware of hidden costs.<br><br>+*<br><br><i>Anthony Discenza is an artist living and working in Oakland.

When I was asked to be part of the reading group for the CCA Wattis Institute for Contemporary Art’s year-long investigation of Seth Price, the first two things that came to mind were Price’s 2008 book <i>How to Disappear in America</i>, which was doing the rounds at art bookshops I worked at in London when I lived there, and the 2012 record <i>Army Jacket</i>, published by <a href = \'https://www.daisrecords.com/\' target= \'new\'>Dais Records</a>, which I sold at my own art bookshop in San Francisco. <br><br>Dais Records was started in 2007 by musicians and record collectors Ryan Martin and Gibby Miller with the specific mission of releasing and distributing “lost” recordings while promoting new and underexposed artists. The first Dais record, a collection of unreleased Genesis P-Orridge tapes from 1968, would set the tone for their project overall: raw, extreme, and occult. Despite releasing obscure tape music and noise recordings, their ethos as a label echoes the intentions of an imprint like Harry Smith\'s Folkways, collecting and redistributing sound to broaden the understanding of a social field.<br><br>Dais has a personal connection for me: co-owner Gibby Miller is a dear friend I’ve known since my teens living in Upstate New York. When Gibby founded Dais records with Ryan Martin in 2007, I assumed at some point we would meet. 11 years later we still have not met in person, but I was honored to speak with Ryan over the phone about Seth Price, the genesis of the <i>Army Jacket</i> project, methods of distribution and consumption of content, CD-R collecting, and the role of music collecting in archives. <br><br>[image1]<br> <br>VM: How did you meet Seth Price and how did the idea to work together come about?<br> <br>RM: How I met Seth was kind of a roundabout way. I was having dinner with a friend of mine named Katy Paycheck, who works in the art world and was putting together a film about Genesis P-Orridge. During dinner, I heard this music overhead. I said  “what is this playing?” She replied \"It\'s my friend Seth Price, it’s a CD called <i>Army Jacket</i>.\" And as the night went on, I have no real, concrete reason as to why I was drawn to it, but I definitely was drawn to it. I was really taken by the album. I was aware of him and his visual work and the vacuum sealed pieces were a thing being written about at the time.<br><br>A couple weeks later, Throbbing Gristle was playing in Brooklyn. I’m down in the basement of the show and I run into Katy Paycheck. Katy told me that she had brought Seth Price with her and really wanted both of us to meet. We met and hit it off instantly… talking about old industrial tape culture and outdated synthesizers. At this point, my label partner, Gibby Miller, and myself had just started Dais Records. I was telling Seth that evening about the new label and how I was really taken by what I had heard from <i>Army Jacket</i>. Seth and I made plans to get together a few weeks later at his former studio, which at that time was in an old factory building in Gowanus, Brooklyn. He gave me all these CD-Rs, stuff he was working on and stuff he was interested in. We just got on really well. I told him that I would like to put out something by him, but it was just a matter of figuring out what exactly that would be. We bounced around a few ideas… a re-issue of an early tape or some avant synth pop material. Then I suggested “How about that <i>Army Jacket</i> CD that Katy Paycheck played for me?.” Not many CDs were distributed of the original.  I may be wrong about this, but I think that it was only sold through Reena Spaulings Gallery during a brief period of time. So we started planning a reissue of <i>Army Jacket</i>. I remember we had a very constructive back and forth exchange about ideas regarding the cover art and packaging of the record. We weren\'t going to use the cover of the CD. We were sending emails back of forth, sounding out ideas and sending examples of things we thought were inspiring. We were sending each other a bunch of private press improv jazz record album covers, discussing their layout and typography and how that was something that could inspire the design of <i>Army Jacket</i>. Some time had gone by and all of a sudden I got this email from Seth saying “I think I have the cover done.” He had just hand drawn it, and used an image of a vacuumed sealed bomber jacket. It had been roughly three years from when we first met and the record’s actual release.<br><br>In between all of this time, I had released a small run, limited edition Seth Price cassette tape in 2010, not through Dais Records. We only made 46 hand-numbered copies. Myself and another artist, Lou Caldarola, had a small tape label called Period Tapes. It was material that Seth had recorded in 2003 and was part of the CD-Rs he was burning for me when I first met him.<br><br>VM: When you talk about <i>Army Jacket</i>, you think of it as an art piece, as well as a music record. Does Dais Records have any other projects that are more like archival or art recordings? <br> <br>RM: There\'ve been a few, it\'s hard to classify certain recordings. We started with doing Genesis Breyer P-Orridge\'s archival recordings. Our first record was this unheard recording from 1967/68. It is an archival art recording in the sense of its historical and creative context, but it does have a bit of musical sensation to it. Not the actual audio, but who is performing on it and what came as a result years later. [Genesis] kind of rides that line of being a musician but also an artist.  The art world likes to keep those two things very exclusive but thankfully more artists, such as Seth Price, have completely ignored that absurd policy.<br><br>Same with a lot of the COUM Transmissions recordings we have released on Dais. It\'s difficult listening if taken at face value, but the releases were more for documentation and distribution. I feel COUM Transmissions was always either under or poorly represented and was overshadowed by Throbbing Gristle. When I started working with Genesis, I had a deep interest in COUM Transmissions for that very reason. Throbbing Gristle had been documented to death. COUM Transmission was the thing that I couldn\'t wait to sink my teeth into. The only real worthwhile writing about it at that time was in the <i>Wreckers of Civilization</i> book by Simon Ford, and there are gaps even in that, because you just couldn\'t put everything in. It was impossible. And I knew there was more. And there was. When I released some of the recordings, the reviews were mixed. It was either \"It\'s cool to finally hear COUM Transmissions\" to \"This is shit, why did you put this out?\" The fact that we have audio of most of this work is incredible, it blows my mind. Overall I think people got it. <br> <br>VM: Do you see record labels and record collecting as a kind of archival practice?<br> <br>RM: In certain isolated cases, yes. I\'m sure every person that is a rabid record collector thinks of themselves as some sort of documentarian, and I\'m sure there were moments in time, when I was younger, where I thought that about myself. I think there are certain people—and they are very few and far between—of which the purpose of their collection is to document and archive with useful intent in mind. You can accumulate all the records you want, but if you\'re not doing anything with it, then what\'s the point outside of just hoarding a bunch of physical object that you like having around? I\'m a firm believer that for it to be an archive, it needs to serve some sort of practical purpose outside of yourself. I don\'t consider my record collection an archive. It\'s just kind of what I\'m into and what I enjoy listening to. There are little pieces in it where I was purposely getting things because I\'m trying to do something later on, whether it\'s working on a reissue project, or writing something, or doing some research. But overall it\'s a personal record collection.<br><br>A good example of someone who uses their collection as a functional archive would be Jan van Toorn who has run Slowscan since 1983. He has a record collection that is just an extension of his research and archival output. It\'s probably one of the greatest collections of art-related recordings ever amassed. I can\'t think of any other person or any institution that has what he has. He seemingly has everything, going back decades, and he has dedicated his life to getting everything and sharing what he can with the world. I think Slowscan is one of the best labels that ever existed. And that\'s an example of how someone\'s record collection became a true, real archive used for something incredible. There are dozens more examples within every genre of music. People who collected rare 78s are the reason any of that music still exists. Early hip-hop collectors saved a lot of rare mixes and documents that would otherwise have been discarded.<br> <br>VM: Do you feel like you are contributing to that kind of archive by doing something like releasing <i>Army Jacket</i> and other recordings on vinyl? <br> <br>RM: I think certain select releases serve that function. The COUM Transmissions material served somewhat of an educational purpose, or at least I hope it did. That was certainly my main intention. While creating something, I don\'t really think of it as being created to be put in an archive. I think of it as making something that I want to hear personally. I want others to hear it as well. I guess I have a more purist idea about archives and the archival thought process because I originally started working with Genesis P-Orridge in an archival capacity before I managed Genesis. That\'s what I did for a handful of years… cataloging the archive and organizing it to be sent to the Tate Britain. That is how we found the original tapes that started Dais Records. <br> <br>VM: Can you say a bit about CD-Rs and the culture around CD-R self-publishing and trading that was going on at the time of Seth’s original release? Do you have a lot of CD-Rs from that time period?<br> <br>RM: Yes, I still have quite a lot of self-released CD-Rs from the past 20 years. I know Seth was involved in that, but he seemingly came into it from a slightly different angle, hence why I didn\'t cross paths with him until 2009. I came from a late 1980s/early 1990s punk background, so trading things and making stuff myself was just the only way I knew how to operate in the world. I had a tape label when I was 14. I was in school putting out everyone\'s weirdo punk stuff. I moved to New York City shortly after high school, and I came here because I got really into noise and experimental music. I fell into that underground art world that was happening in the East Village at that time. Everyone was into noise, collecting tapes and distributing CD-Rs. The CD-R thing happened really heavily around 2001. I was in this drone three-piece, we had some CD-Rs, and we would burn them off and trade them. When I very first met Gibby Miller, the first thing I did was bring him a stack of CD-Rs, weird shit that I was working on and rare recordings by avant-garde artists past and present. This was around 2002. I know Seth was doing the same thing but in a different sphere of people acting in the same manner but independently of one another. Seems to be the way culture has always operated in New York City.<br> <br>You can buy the digital version of <a href = \'https://www.daisrecords.com/collections/seth-price/products/seth-price-army-jacket-lp\' target= \'new\'>Seth Price’s <i>Army Jacket</i> from Dais Records</a>. <br><br>[image2]<br><br><i><a href = \'https://www.daisrecords.com/\' target= \'new\'>Dais Records</a> was founded in 2007 by Gibby Miller and Ryan Martin.

They are applied to wooden boards, marble fragments, aged paper, or directly onto the wall.

She uses a repertoire of invented shapes - she calls them \"reincarnations\" - that are altered, bent, and endlessly re-adjusted. A simple dot or a line will not do. \"It wouldn’t be idiosyncratic enough,\" she says. <br><br>If painting lies at the center of this work, different paths lead up to it and emerge out from it.

It’s where we go to feel safe and protected, to put our guard down, rest, and build ourselves back up. It’s our innermost sanctuary, our last line of defense: when everything feels like it’s falling apart, we can always just stay in bed. At the same time, the bedroom is where we go to expose ourselves to others, to test and experiment with what our bodies want and need from and can do to other bodies—which can be soft and sensual but can also get loud, sweaty, and even a bit rough. For those (and many other) reasons, the bedroom needs a door that closes, so that it can be kept separate from the rest of the house. It’s where private gets even more private, or, as my aunt Judy likes to say, it’s the <i>indoors indoors</i>. And even though it’s our most familiar place (considering we’re there for hours every single day), it’s also our most sacred and cherished possession, shared with others only at personal risk. <br><br>(... <a href=\"/on-our-mind/dodie-bellamy-is-on-our-mind-2018-2019/introduction-by-anthony-huberman\">continue reading</a>)<br><br>*<br><br><i>A series of open questions</i>:<br><br>What is new about narrative?

What is a body beyond its interior and its exterior? What happens to love when it clutches trauma? What is <i>Barf</i> art? What does the vulgar have to do with the poetic? How can excess and reason co-exist? Is the intellectual always in conflict with the libidinal? What kinds of intimacies can and can\'t be narrativized? Is anything sexier than <i>don\'t tell anybody?</i> <br><br>How can vulnerability and exposure become productive and political forces? Where are the tiny revolts? What are today\'s many feminisms?

It’s nice to think of him out on the streets of greater New York with his 16mm camera, directing his actors (his brother George in head-to-toe leather and their shared-star, Floraine, dressed in a tight cleavage-revealing number) to lick their lips and kiss while waiting for their dog Bocco to do his business.

It didn’t have to be a hundred pages, as long as it came out just as fast as people could write for it.

Thus by stealth and subterfuge <i>Mirage</i> had gorgeous covers by the likes of John Baldessari, Matthew Barney, Jennifer Bartlett, Louise Bourgeois, John Cage, Vija Celmins, Chuck Close, John Currin, Jeremy Deller, Tom Friedman, Ellen Gallagher, Nan Goldin, Robert Gober, Michael Graves, Thomas Hirschhorn, Jess, Chris Johanson, Mike Kelley, Ellsworth Kelly, Jeff Koons, Sol LeWitt, Meredith Monk, Tony Oursler, Raymond Pettibon, Pierre et Gilles, Jack Pierson, Richard Prince, Charles Ray, Bridget Riley, Peter Saul, Carolee Schneeman, Kiki Smith, Torbjorn Vejvi, Bill Viola, Sue Williams and dozens more.  In conversation, Charles Bernstein called this practice the “absolute low end of high art.”<br>[image2]<br><i>Mirage</i> has also gone into the archive and sponsored first publication of work by writers such as Jack Spicer, Robert Duncan, Djuna Barnes, Marianne Moore, Robin Blaser, Christa Wolf, Allen Ginsberg, Helen Adam, George Oppen, James Broughton, William Bronk, Philip Lamantia, John Wieners, Joe Dunn, et al.  In the nature of zines, the stakes are low.  It’s easy to take risks.  We wanted to recontextualize the work of prestigious writers by jamming them up against unknown, beginning, or, frankly, non-writers.  We printed the Goth-death poems of the security guard at New College next to Jackson Mac Low or Barbara Guest - to invent a new economy of reading.<br>[image3]<br>The zine shut down in 2009 when an officious office manager blamed me for wasting hundreds of pages of office paper.  It was either get fired or submit to authoritarian rule.  Under the auspices of the Wattis Institute, an enlightened regime, we are returning to give the world 10 or 12 new monthly issues.<br><br>- Kevin Killian<br><br><br><br><i>Edited by Kevin Killian between 1985 and 1989, </i>Mirage<i> ran for four issues.

It\'s more of a state of mind than a specific type of activity. On one hand, to be an athlete is about the violence inherent in always being observed, judged, and evaluated. But it’s also about the joy that comes with overcoming an obstacle. It involves living a life where danger and pain might possibly become exuberance and celebration—or might not. It begins and ends with risk.<br><br>For Diamond Stingily, to be an athlete can involve sports, sure, but it also relates to her experience with making art. There are the many types of ambitions, fears, and expectations—some her own, and others imposed on her. There are the encouraging milestones and the personal triumphs, but the goalposts are also always shifting. It is relentless. <br><br>While Stingily’s work speaks to broader socio-cultural themes like class, race, and gender, it is always rooted in her own life. She grew up playing volleyball and softball. Both of her brothers are former professional football players. The family trophies were kept on a bookshelf in the living room. She used to bury her dolls in the backyard. She has been a poet and artist for most of her life.

It\'s more of a state of mind than a specific type of activity. On one hand, to be an athlete is about the violence inherent in always being observed, judged, and evaluated. But it\'s also about the joy that comes with overcoming an obstacle. It involves living a life where danger and pain might possibly become exuberance and celebration - or might not. It begins and ends with risk.<br><br>For Diamond Stingily, to be an athlete can involve sports, sure, but it also relates to her experience with making art. There are the many types of ambitions, fears, and expectations - some her own, and others imposed on her. There are the encouraging milestones and the personal triumphs, but the goalposts are also always shifting. It is relentless. <br><br>Click <a href=\'/gallery/diamond-stingily-doing-the-best-i-can-2019\'>here</a> for more information on Diamond Stingily and to read an essay by the artist.<br><br>[image2]<br><br><a href=\"/gallery/rosha-yaghmai-miraclegrow-2019\">Rosha Yaghmai</a>: <i> Miraclegrow</i><br><br>Can a body inherit memory?

To disrupt one\'s experience of these can powerfully affect space and time. <i>Miraclegrow</i> is a supersized disruption, an exaggerated shift in scale and perception. Yaghmai\'s magnification of a bathroom floor reimagines reality and asks us to consider a new perspective, possibly one of a small household spider. A 17-foot “hair” fashioned from a bent, fused, rusted pipe sits awaiting inspection. A castaway hair, an expended shred of biomaterial carries evidence of unique genetic information, of past drug use, of cheap shampoo. An unnaturally close look at this particle of life is on offer. We see its scales, made from castings and detritus, reminiscent of sedimentary stone, tide pools, and the sand dunes of Mars. The hair reflects onto giant glossy tiles lining the walls, showing some undefined landscape in the process of disappearing or reappearing.

We know that the human body is comprised of multiple cavities that carry our insides, completing our bodies through their absence, never visible from the exterior. Cavities are markers of decay, gapes in the smooth enamel of our teeth, that allude to underlying breakdown. Some of us will lose ’em all (a mouthful of cavities, as the song goes). The list of tangible cavities is long—the orifice of a tree, the gap between our walls, underground caverns. Then there are the less perceptible ones, like nebulas, or the electromagnetic energy between the surface of the Earth and the inner edge of the upper atmosphere, <i>55 kilometers up</i>, or what lies beneath our disintegrating glaciers. A cavity itself is a falsehood, a hole inside a whole.<br><br>Cavity living involves a degree of slipperiness, in which the parameters of time feel hazy. It is unclear whether we are in now or then, in the way that we are uncertain if these vitrines possess anything inside of their drawers (or if they are drawers at all). Walls and pillars are hollowed out, an escape hatch is blocked, a door has the contour of a cabinet but is cut like a frame. Artifice is the vernacular, as told by this painting that is in fact a green portal, a futuristic form that indicates we may be elsewhere rather than here. The architecture, in its exposure and impairment, renders vulnerability and trauma as much as absence and disappearance.

Du Bois’s notion of double consciousness, Owusu creates a third cinematic space representing the diverse identities of African immigrants interacting in African, white American, and Black American culture. Although the internal pressures and external conflicts associated with double consciousness persist in Owusu’s work, she integrates what Du Bois excludes—feminism, queerness, immigrant consciousnesses, and all their intersections.<br><br>At the heart of many of Owusu’s works is the fraught relationship between beauty and power. Black hair culture as an art form in postcolonial Ghana, manifestations of racial capitalism in the beauty industry, and colorism are frequent topics. Of particular interest are the ways in which the ideology of beauty centers whiteness and functions as a hegemonic system of control. Owusu illustrates the Black trauma that is a consequence of white standards of beauty through a manipulation of film and a use of imagery and sound that seem incongruous, while pointing to the absurdity of these power structures.<br><br>Blackness is fundamentally entangled with loss, displacement, and memory; it is a manifold existence. At the root of what Owusu identifies as her “warring consciousness” is the anxiety that she is too Ghanaian for America, and too American for Ghana.

Ulbricht was an ardent libertarian who believed Silk Road—described by the New York Times as “the largest, most sophisticated criminal enterprise the internet has ever seen”—was battling the forces of big government.

Lee</a> reads this event as a fairy tale of disruption rather than an isolated episode in the history of the dark net, Silicon Valley, and the relationship between public libraries and digital culture. Lee argues that the notion of “disruptive” technology in contemporary culture has radically affected our relationship to knowledge, history, language, aesthetics, reading, and truth. Against the backdrop of her account of Ulbricht and his exploits, Lee provides original readings of five women artists—Gretchen Bender, Cecile B. Evans, Josephine Pryde, Carissa Rodriguez, and Martine Syms—who weigh in, either explicitly or inadvertently, on the nature of contemporary media and technology. Written as a work of experimental art criticism, <i>The Glen Park Library</i> is both a homage to the Bay Area and an excoriation of the ethos of Silicon Valley. As with all fairy tales, the book\'s ultimate subjects are much greater, however, and Lee casts a critical eye on collisions between privacy and publicity, knowledge and information, and the past and future that are enabled by the technocratic worldview.<br><br>Lee reads from her book and then discusses it with <a href = \'https://bampfa.org/\' target= \'new\'>Apsara DiQuinzio</a>, curator of Modern and Contemporary Art at Berkeley Museum of Art and Pacific Film Archive.<br><br>This event is co-presented with <a href = \'http://noplacepress.com/\' target= \'new\'>no place press</a>.<br><br>///Book Launch: <i>The Glen Park Library</i> by Pamela M.

Dodie Bellamy is on our mind: Jack Halberstam on \"Nothing\"',_binary 'In his brilliant, humorous, and whimsical parody of a Smithsonian book titled <i>American History in 101 Objects</i>, artist Chris E. Vargas, in 2015, invited visitors into his imaginary Museum of Transgender Hirstory to see a show titled <i>Transgender Hirstory in 99 Objects</i>. Riffing on the self-importance of the Smithsonian title, the precision of its 101 objects and its investment in the notion of authentic history in the first place, Vargas called attention to the way that a history of gender variance will necessarily fall by the wayside in any canonical account of American history and will require its own object lessons. The objects that collectively tell the story of gender variance are counter-intuitive and suggestive, risqué and emblematic. For Vargas’s show, the objects ranged from queer banners by Tuesday Smillie to sculptures of hybrid creatures and photographic records of transgender lives gone by.

They claim space, perhaps even <i>compress</i> space. They are not models or surrogates for something else. They aren’t <i>also</i> elsewhere, the way images can be. Their job is to make manifest, in physical form, some of what is <i>not</i> here, or at least not visibly so - the psyche, the libido, and everything else that remains unsaid and unsayable.<br><br>Driven by impulse and intuition, the artist folds, cuts, turns over, and twists back. He ties knots into other knots. Bit by bit, he locates the sharpest edges of whatever emerges - the parts of an object that cut into ideas in a way that makes them nervous or puts them on alert. Eventually, each sculpture is wound up until it can’t be made any tighter, sharpened until it can’t be made any sharper, and released into the wild. <br><br>These sculptures are tools that try to access the abstract. They work at getting a bit closer to it, maybe even to stick their toes in it, to get dirty with it. Fecteau doesn’t invent an abstract form as much as he learns how to find one. <br><br>This exhibition, the artist\'s first in the Bay Area in over 15 years, features an entirely new body of work.<br><br>Vincent Fecteau (b. 1969, Islip, NY) lives and works in San Francisco. <br><br>(continue reading full curatorial essay online <a href=\'/gallery/vincent-fecteau-2019/ten-attempts-to-say-something-about-an-untitled-exhibition-of-untitled-sculptures-by-vincent-fecteau-by-anthony-huberman\'>here</a> or download a PDF <a href=\'https://wattis.org/media/02356.pdf\'>here</a>)<br><br>Public Programs:<br><a href=\'/calendar/saturday-september-7-2019\'>September 7</a>: Lecture by Fanny Singer<br><a href=\'/calendar/wednesday-september-25-2019\'>September 25</a>: Kathy Butterly and Vincent Fecteau in conversation<br><br><i>Vincent Fecteau</i> is curated by Anthony Huberman and organized by Leila Grothe.

Over the next academic year, we weave through the lyrical and the theoretical, through postcoloniality and feminism, to poetry and auto-ethnography. We begin with a lecture about Trinh T. Minh-ha by <a href=\"/calendar/tuesday-september-24-2019\">Ute Meta Bauer</a> in September. Then, we reconvene in October at SFMOMA for a <a href=\"/calendar/thursday-october-17-2019\">screening</a> of <i>Shoot for the Contents</i>, with an introduction by <a href=\"/calendar/thursday-october-17-2019\">Việt Lê</a> on the multidimensional question of color and the politics of translation. In November, <a href=\"/calendar/thursday-november-7-2019\">Trinh T. Minh-ha</a> herself presents a talk on the voice of multiplicity. Before the year ends, we share a dinner together at <a href=\"/calendar/wednesday-december-11-2019\">Cafe Ohlone</a> in xučyun (Berkeley), where we learn about this land and the food that grows from the tidal marshes, flats, and hills along the eastern flank of this Bay. <br><br>We start the new year with <a href=\"/calendar/friday-january-10-2020\">DJ Lynnée Denise</a> exploring the links between gospel, the queer roots of disco and house music, and the heartbeat as a rhythmic sign of life. After, Trinh T. Minh-ha returns with <a href=\"/calendar/friday-february-28-2020\">Isaac Julien</a> (with an introduction by <a href=\"/calendar/friday-february-28-2020\">Ranu Mukherjee</a>), continuing a conversation on fragility, political commitment, and sensitivity in filmmaking that has unfolded over their decades-long friendship.

We intended to hear <a href=\"/calendar/friday-april-24-2020\">Adam and Zack Khalil</a> re-imagine an ancient Ojibway prophecy that is both a record of the past and a foretelling of what is to come, transcending linear colonized history to propose new Indigenous futures. Instead, throughout the spring and summer <a href=\"/calendar/july-2-september-4-2020\">Kameelah Janan Rasheed</a> reminds us that text is a living organism and form is not finite, releasing an anthology of unfinished writing, ideas, and iterations that brings us closer to one another. Throughout the spring and summer, <a href=\"/calendar/april-august-2020\">a series of missives</a>, ruminating on time, labour, grief, capitalism, speed, nonsense, and power appears in our inboxes. In between, <a href=\"/calendar/may-1-september-4-2020\">Divya Mehra</a> shares a series of postcards for these end times, revealing to us that in actuality our end began long, long ago.

Recognized for her innovative and experimental approaches to image-making and storytelling, Trinh’s work has significantly influenced numerous artists, directors, and thinkers across several generations. She dedicates her practice to questioning totalising systems of knowledge and representations and categories of identity, and has made profound contributions to the fields of postcolonial and feminist studies. <br><br>[image1]<br><br>Raised in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War, Trinh studied piano and music composition at the National Conservatory of Music and Theater in Saigon. She moved to the United States in 1970 to study composition, ethnomusicology, and French Literature at the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, completing an MA in French Literature, a Master of Music, and a PhD in French and Francophone Literatures. Her research would eventually take her to Senegal and Dakar, where she studied cinema and cultural theory. <br><br>Trinh posits her films as \"boundary events,\" existing in a zone between labels—a place where new labels might form or dissolve or cross over one another, allowing the work to evade categorization. The work inhabits spaces between documentary fiction and experimental film, enhanced by the use of reflexive cinematic techniques and editorial processes that challenge the traditional documentary form and deconstructs modes of thinking and looking. <br><br>To date, she has produced eight films that have been honored in over forty retrospectives around the world: <a href=\"/on-our-mind/trinh-t-minh-ha-is-on-our-mind-2019-2020/about-trinh-t-minh-ha/forgetting-vietnam-90-mins-2015\"><i>Forgetting Vietnam</i></a> (90 mins, 2015); <a href=\"/on-our-mind/trinh-t-minh-ha-is-on-our-mind-2019-2020/about-trinh-t-minh-ha/night-passage-98-mins-2004\"><i>Night Passage</i></a> (98 mins, 2004); <a href=\"/on-our-mind/trinh-t-minh-ha-is-on-our-mind-2019-2020/about-trinh-t-minh-ha/the-fourth-dimension-87-mins-2001\"><i>The Fourth Dimension</i></a> (87 min, 2001); <a href=\"/on-our-mind/trinh-t-minh-ha-is-on-our-mind-2019-2020/about-trinh-t-minh-ha/a-tale-of-love-108-mins-1995-released-1996\"><i>A Tale of Love</i></a> (108 mins, 1995), an experimental narrative; <a href=\"/on-our-mind/trinh-t-minh-ha-is-on-our-mind-2019-2020/about-trinh-t-minh-ha/shoot-for-the-contents-102-mins-1991\"><i>Shoot for the Contents</i></a> (102 mins, 1991), a film on culture, art and politics in China; <a href=\"/on-our-mind/trinh-t-minh-ha-is-on-our-mind-2019-2020/about-trinh-t-minh-ha/surname-viet-given-name-nam-108-mins-1989\"><i>Surname Viet Given Name Nam</i></a> (108 mins, 1989), a film on identity and culture through the struggle of Vietnamese women; <a href=\"/on-our-mind/trinh-t-minh-ha-is-on-our-mind-2019-2020/about-trinh-t-minh-ha/naked-spaces-living-is-round-135-mins-1985\"><i>Naked Spaces - Living is Round</i></a> (135 mins, 1985); and <a href=\"/on-our-mind/trinh-t-minh-ha-is-on-our-mind-2019-2020/about-trinh-t-minh-ha/reassemblage-40-mins-1982\"><i>Reassemblage</i></a> (40 mins, 1982).<br><br>[image2]<br><br>She has published countless articles, book chapters, and journal contributions (156, to be exact) on cinema, cultural politics, feminism and the art, and is the author of twelve books, including <i>Lovecidal: Walking with The Disappeared</i> (Fordham University Press, 2016), <i>D-Passage: The Digital Way</i> (Duke University Press, 2013), <i>Elsewhere, Within Here</i> (Routledge, 2011), <i>Cinema Interval</i> (Routledge, 1999), <i>Framer Framed</i> (Routledge, 1992), <i>When the Moon Waxes Red: Representation, Gender & Cultural Politics</i> (Routledge, 1991), and the canonical <i>Woman, Native, Other: Writing Postcoloniality and Feminism</i> (Indiana University Press, 1989).

Minh-ha’s thinking, writing, filming, and editing inform and influence each other. Bauer introduces Trinh’s cinematic oeuvre and its habitation in a multiplicity of spaces: of language, translation and passage, longing, and culture. <br><br><a href=\"/on-our-mind/trinh-t-minh-ha-is-on-our-mind-2019-2020\">Trinh T. Minh-ha</a> is one of the outstanding feminist thinkers of our time. Her practice, as a writer, filmmaker, composer, and artist manifests many layers. She has been teaching for more than two decades at the University of California, Berkeley as Professor of Gender & Women Studies and Rhetoric.  <br><br>Leaving her native country during the Vietnam War, she came to the United States in 1970 for her university education. Her first film <a href=\"/on-our-mind/trinh-t-minh-ha-is-on-our-mind-2019-2020/about-trinh-t-minh-ha/reassemblage-40-mins-1982\"><i>Reassemblage</i></a> (1982) was filmed in Senegal where she taught music and where she, together with artist and architect Jean-Paul Bourdier, documented West-African vernacular architecture. <br><br>“The story never really begins nor ends,” states Trinh in her book <i>Woman, Native, Other</i> published in 1989, the same year her seminal film essay <a href=\"/on-our-mind/trinh-t-minh-ha-is-on-our-mind-2019-2020/about-trinh-t-minh-ha/surname-viet-given-name-nam-108-mins-1989\"><i>Surname Viet Given Name Nam</i></a> was released. Her work is shaped by being in a state of exile, living in diaspora alongside her family, sharing memories and images with others through the voices of her protagonists, the tonality of light and shadow, through nearness and distance. Her work brings to the fore the deep and lasting emotional impact dislocation has on the individual. <br><br>Bauer met Trinh for the first time in 2001, surprisingly, not in the cinema but in the context of her first solo show at the Secession in Vienna. This exhibition featured a number of her films in tent-like structures in the large gallery of the institution, allowing the audience to watch her films in parallel. The next encounter was in 2002, during Documenta11 where four of her films, including <i>Surname Viet Given Name Nam</i>, were presented. This film was later featured in the format of an installation in Bauer’s inaugural exhibition <i>Paradise Lost</i> (2013) at the NTU Centre for Contemporary Art Singapore.<br><br><a href=\"http://research.ntu.edu.sg/expertise/academicprofile/Pages/StaffProfile.aspx?ST_EMAILID=UBAUER\" target = \'new\'>Ute Meta Bauer</a> is the Founding Director of NTU CCA Singapore, and Professor, School of Art, Design and Media, NTU, Singapore.

These sculptures are tools.<br><br>Some artists begin with an idea or an opinion, and use it to make an artwork—first comes the meaning, then comes the object. But for <a href=\'/gallery/vincent-fecteau-2019\'>Vincent Fecteau</a>, ideas never work. His sculptures don’t come as a result of an idea but are the tools he uses in his attempt to generate ideas and make meaning.<br><br>He begins with an initial impulse or desire (the specific trigger quickly becomes irrelevant) and proceeds by folding, cutting, twisting, trimming, adding, leveling, scraping off, smoothing out, carving away, turning over, twisting back, and adding again. He ties knots into other knots. Bit by bit, he locates the sharpest edges of whatever emerges—the parts of an object that cut into meaning in a way that makes ideas nervous or that puts them on alert. Eventually, each sculpture is wound up until it can’t be made any tighter, sharpened until it can’t be made any sharper, and it is released into the wild, perhaps to become a tool for other people as well.<br><br>[image2]<br><br>2. These sculptures are abstract.<br><br>Everything is abstract. By which I mean—a thick sludge of matter, energies, and consciousness is all there really is, at the end of the day. And these sculptures are simply tools that try to access the abstract. They work at getting a bit closer to it, maybe even to stick their toes in it, to get dirty with it. Fecteau doesn’t invent an abstract form as much as he learns how to find one.<br><br>These sculptures don’t believe in distinguishing the abstract from the really real. Abstraction is not a chosen style or a composition but is deeply human—it’s about the lived experience of locating and co-existing with it. Any other artwork, be it a figurative painting or a realistic photograph, is just as abstract as Fecteau’s, only differently so.<br><br>That said, these sculptures aren’t anchored to the world by being connected to a recognizable topic, message, or, worse, an instruction for how to think or what to believe. Instead, they communicate by speaking a language art is particularly good at—that of arranged shapes, colors, textures, intuitions, and intentions. <i>I decided not to approach content directly, but to trust that it would follow me as I moved around the room. </i> (Fecteau).<br><br>[image3]<br><br>3. These sculptures are made by Vincent Fecteau.<br><br>Fecteau grew up on Long Island, went to Wesleyan, studied painting, interned with Hannah Wilke for a summer, didn’t like New York that much. He took time off from college and moved to San Francisco in 1990 to work with ACT UP. He worked as a studio assistant to Nayland Blake for a few years, handpainted ceramics, and ended up as a florist. He had his first show in 1994, consisting mostly of photo-collages of cats. When Blake decamped for the East Coast, Fecteau took over his apartment and has been making his handcrafted sculptures ever since. When I asked him what he was reading these past few months, he mentioned <i>Now the Night Begins</i>, a novel written by the French filmmaker Alain Guiraudie (<i>Stranger by the Lake</i>). He lives near Balboa Park in the Mission Terrace neighborhood. There is a great painting by Tomma Abts in his kitchen. He bikes everywhere.<br><br>[image4]<br><br>4. These sculptures are necessary.<br><br>Like practically any other work of art, these sculptures are made by someone who needs to make them. The question is not to ask <i>how</i> Fecteau makes them but <i>why</i> he makes them. The answer, always, is somewhat embarrassing or humiliating, since the sculptures end up saying more about the artist than anything else. They reveal too much, because all self-portraits reveal too much. In all they say about his achievements and capabilities, they say just as much about his limitations. They contain his secrets.<br><br>But these objects also embody the contradictions that all of us are: they appear calm yet agitated, exposed but also secretive, fully formed but still formless.<br><br>[image5]<br><br>5. These sculptures are traps. <br><br>Vince sends me a Youtube link. It’s a talk by the artist Don Potts, from 1981.<br><br><i>You go to that feeling, you work on the trap, the trap sucks the feeling in, makes the feeling a little bit more concrete, you go back to the trap, you get rid of the junk, you build a more pure version, you go back to the feeling, and you just go back and forth. And over the course of the whole process, you start sucking this thing in, sucking this thing in—the trap is starting to catch it. (…) And then, one part of this trap becomes very important. No fussing around in this area. Other areas, you know, there’s some glue hanging off it, or maybe an inch too big, it’s not important. (…) What you’re trying to catch is something you’ve never had your hands on. It’s subtler than you can think, than your awareness can comprehend. So the trap has to be subtler than any trap you’ve ever made. You can’t use old trap-making techniques. It will just get you so far, but it won’t take you that last step, to catch that thing. So you’re all alone, well not all alone, mom is always around, [laughter], but you can’t go to history books, you can’t go to past work, you have to just respond to what it is you’re trying to catch. And it gets incredibly exciting. (…) At the last moment, when you put the last touches on the trap, something will happen. It’s not a trap anymore, it is what you’ve been trying to catch. This thing becomes that awareness or that idea, or whatever—you can’t talk about these things with words, you know. And there it is. And you look at it. And there have been times when I’ve just, you know, cried. Not, you know, going- to-lie-down-on-the-bed crying, [laughter] but emotion will just pour out of my eyes. </i>(Don Potts)<br><br>[image6]<br><br>6. These sculptures are leaps of faith.<br><br>The painter Agnes Martin talked about <i>surrendering</i> the intellect. For many, to allow experience to precede cognition is a scary proposition. It puts us in a vulnerable place—walls need to be down, filters off. But what is art about if not vulnerability? Clicking back to Don Potts: <i>you need to be working right at that bottom edge of your nervous system. </i><br><br>Fecteau never draws and never makes preliminary sketches—he jumps right in. When he makes a cut into a shape, he can’t click undo but can only allow consequences to determine his next set of decisions. There is no safety net. It’s like when you delete that sentence you’ve become really attached to, even though you don’t yet know what will replace it. These sculptures don’t <i>know</i>, they <i>believe</i>. <br><br><i>These sculptures are made the way kids build backyard spaceships, with meticulous attention to detail, a grudging respect for the trash he works with, and no real hope of re-creating what he sees when he closes his eyes.</i> (Dennis Cooper)<br><br>[image7]<br><br>7. These sculptures are new.<br><br>Even if they resemble others that came before it. They were made all at once, as a group, over the period of a year and a half. Decisions have migrated from one to another, making them siblings, of sorts—related but self-sufficient. They are made of carved foam, painted papier-mâché, and bits of resin clay. Some 3-D scanning and a 5-axis CNC router were also involved at one point in the process, which, for the artist, has been an experiment.<br><br>[image8]<br><br>8. These sculptures are evidence.<br><br>These sculptures are the physical traces of a desire, an intention, or an impulse. They provide evidence of personal and material limitations. They capture the artist’s present state of mind, putting it on display for all to see. <br><br>They are also evidence of a battle between what is and what needs to be. They began on an open battlefield, where possibilities seemed endless. The material made a move, the artist made another, and art made yet another, each maneuvering itself away from, around, but also closer to the other. As they close in on each other, the decisions get smaller and smaller. The grip tightens. <br><br>To some of you, these sculptures will resonate, or strike a chord. They will prove that you share something with someone else. They are evidence that you are not alone.<br><br>[image9]<br><br>9. These sculptures are here. <br><br>They sit on white pedestals, on display in a gallery. They claim space, perhaps even <i>compress</i> space. They are not models or surrogates for something else. They aren’t <i>also</i> elsewhere, the way images can be. <i>They exist in the world irreducibly and uncontainably</i> (Fecteau). Their job is to make manifest, in physical form, some of what is <i>not</i> here, or at least not visibly so—the psyche, the libido, and everything else that remains unsaid and unsayable.<br><br>Also here are photographs by <a href=\'https://www.greenenaftaligallery.com/artists/lutz-bacher/\' target=\'new\'>Lutz Bacher</a>. She and Fecteau have been friends for many years, often sharing ideas and inspirations. Sometimes, Fecteau would come across an object or a situation and would immediately know—<i>that’s a Lutz</i>. He would have to pull over or stop to take a picture, and send it to her. She would usually respond with an emoji or two. Years later, much to his delight, he would find out that she had turned the image or object into an artwork. Before she passed away, just a few months ago, the two artists had the idea of including some of those in this exhibition—works by Bacher that had originally been images Fecteau had found and sent her. They come back to him now, charged with life and friendship.<br><br>[image10]<br><br>10. These sculptures are untouchable.<br><br>Which is ironic, because they were made by hand and consist of nothing other than the physical traces of the artist’s own touch. But these sculptures are untouchable in the way sound is untouchable—physically felt but impossible to actually hold on to. They look like what a polyrhythmic piece of music might look like, where many rhythms are made to intersect and overlap, even if they’re all happening at the same time, on top of each other.<br><br><i>I imagine an artwork as a fire that people gather around</i>, Fecteau once said. His sculptures are untouchable not because they might burn your hand but because the “art” in them is located in the energy they generate and in the emotions they mobilize. And, like the warmth of a fire or a melody, these sculptures can’t be photographed. Should you try, most of the object will be absent from the image—and that’s sculpture’s great advantage over other forms of art: it’s always hiding something. As Don Potts said about his traps, <i>if too much of the hook is exposed, the fish doesn’t bite.</i><br><br>[image11]<br><br>P.S. These sculptures are not art.<br><br><i>Art is an ideal. It’s not an actual object. Objects can be evidence of an aspiration to “art,” but I think “art,” as a concept, is something bigger. It’s truth. It’s beyond museums and galleries and even artists. It’s out of our reach. How we use our limited means to try and approach this truth can be very moving.</i> (Fecteau)<br><br>*<br><br>The images above are different views and details of a single work: Vincent Fecteau, <i>Untitled</i>, 2006, papier-mâché, acrylic, 35 × 78 × 65 cm.

Her figurative sculptures, often powerful matriarchs or elusively androgynous empaths, bring together a range of references such as high art, hiphop, lowrider culture, and long-lost ancestors of all kinds. Simpson recently joined <span style=\"color:#ff0000\">Jessica Silverman Gallery</span> and has a solo show there this fall.

The act, as a process, is consigning ourselves to the unknown.<br><br>For the duration of this exhibition, the galleries have been converted into a temporary radio station and stage.

Alongside activation from the public, the 24-hour station is further punctuated by a series of programs, ranging from DJ sets and lectures to comedy and news. <br><br>A retelling of the Brazilian poet Oswald de Andrade\'s 1937 play <i>A Morta</i>, the installation is an instrument for its own transformation. Participants assume the roles of characters in Andrade\'s play, their choices constructing and deconstructing a script. Audio streams into the gallery space, where viewers listen in real time to a chorus of sounds and voices, as well as pauses, moments of silence, and brisk interruptions that progressively compose a narrative sequence. The work destabilizes the expectation of creative authorship in favor of collective decision-making, resulting in playful, dramatic, and unexpected interventions.<br><br>Cinthia Marcelle (b. 1974, Belo Horizonte, Brazil) lives and works in São Paulo.<br><br>Click <a href=\'/gallery/cinthia-marcelle-et-al-a-morta-2019-20\'>here</a> for more information. <br><br>.+*<br><br>CCA Wattis Institute<br>360 Kansas Street <br>San Francisco<br><a href=\'http://www.wattis.org/\'>www.wattis.org</a>',_binary '<i>Cinthia Marcelle: A morta</i> is curated by Kim Nguyen and organized by Leila Grothe.

The light bulb is exhausted, and thus no longer has any practical value, but the idea itself, endorsed by a renowned artist through his signature and enshrined in a sumptuous container, is nevertheless fetishized.

We know that the human body is comprised of multiple cavities that carry our insides, completing our bodies through their absence, never visible from the exterior. Cavities are markers of decay, gapes in the smooth enamel of our teeth, that allude to underlying breakdown. Some of us will lose ’em all (a mouthful of cavities, as the song goes). The list of tangible cavities is long— the orifice of a tree, the gap between our walls, underground caverns. Then there are the less perceptible ones, like nebulas, or the electromagnetic energy between the surface of the Earth and the inner edge of the upper atmosphere, <i>55 kilometers up</i>, or what lies beneath our disintegrating glaciers. A cavity itself is a falsehood, a hole inside a whole.<br><br><font color=\"#696969\">“8 April, Tuesday: The museum staff leave, Fedayeen, or members of a militia, take over the grounds of the museum and start shooting at US troops–the external walls of the museum are pitted with the impact of bullets. The staff tried to return to the museum but were unable to because of fighting in the area. There was also a sniper shooting from a second floor room in the museum.”</font><sup>1</sup><br><br>How do we define a cavity of time? It is all the space in between that gives shape to our existence. There’s coffee and thin cigarettes and walking and walking and sleeping too early and waking too late, going to the studio and not staying at the studio, there’s stretching and eating and more walking and more coffee, there are  ashes of guilt and trips to the chiropractor, storytelling and forgetting names, reading and forgetting names, considering the productive potential of neglect while admiring a blue winged bird, more walking, and more coffee. There is a lot of discussion about bad art and how to make bad art good art, there are beelines from one park to another, sewn together by attentive steps along sandy edges, it’s dancing alone, staying inside, a claustrophobia only cured by foliage and fauna. It is boredom, getting empty, feeling empty, being empty, working less, having less, being with less. Finding what is visible to be made invisible, what is left, what is lost, what we have, what we will never have again, what we cannot find, what we do not know, what belongs to whom, when what is from when remains undefined. When it is and it isn’t. Nothing and everything, a hole inside a whole.<br><br><font color=\"#696969\">“9 April, Wednesday: The statue of Saddam is pulled down (watched by millions of television viewers worldwide), perhaps providing a perfect cover for a heist. Two ‘armored personnel carriers’ were seen in the museum grounds by the local population who all seem to agree on that fact. A number of people went into the museum and stayed there ‘for two hours,’ according to the general estimate. They came out carrying many boxes and then left (there is no confirmation for this story from other sources). They apparently went in through the small side door of the museum for which they had a key (this door was still open on 10 April). The back door was also open– someone had forgotten to lock it.”</font><br><br>Cavity living involves a degree of slipperiness, in which the parameters of time feel hazy. It is unclear whether we are in now or then, in the way that we are uncertain if these vitrines possess anything inside of their cabinets (or if they are cabinets at all). Walls and pillars are hollowed out, an escape hatch is blocked, plywood has the contour of a gate but is cut like a  rame. Artifice is the vernacular, as told by this painting that is in fact a green portal, a futuristic form that indicates we may be elsewhere rather than here. The architecture, in its exposure and impairment, renders vulnerability and injury as much as absence and disappearance. We are in a beautiful and bruised sentiment.<br><br><font color=\"#696969\">“10 April, Thursday: Looting by the mob begins. Some people apparently went in through a small door which was open at the back of the museum. Later, the mob opened the small door near the main entrance and broke down the main door from the inside. Muhsin, the guard, tried to convince the American tank crew positioned nearby to come and protect the museum–they came once and drove off the looters but refused to remain, saying that ‘they had no orders to do so.’ Muhsin tried to chase away the mob, was frightened, left the museum and set off home.”</font><br><br>ON INJURY<br><br>On occasion we fail to remember the origin of a chronic injury. Or we recall with exactitude the moment of injury, but its manifestations have morphed into new, unrecognizable forms that feel disconnected from its provenance. Elbow pain, first associated with stress, can transform into intermittent spasms from overexertion, eventually making itself known as a pinprick of pain each time the humidity drops. There is a phantom injury that connects said elbow to your knee, inexplicably. It is all too familiar, a tingle, a veil of soreness, a well-trodden ache that functions like clockwork. What is true for the elbow and the knee is true for the heart and the head.<br><br><font color=\"#696969\">“11 April, Friday: Local mobs continue to loot the museum. The glass doors leading to the administrative offices are broken down by the mob, who go through and start pillaging the office furniture. Tables and chairs, computers, and other office equipment are hauled away. The curator’s safe was professionally drilled and opened, the salaries of the staff for the next two months were taken, as was her personal money—she had left it in the safe for safe-keeping. The keys of the museum were also taken from her safe.<br><br>A sharpshooter who had set up in a room on the second floor,  res at the US troops below through a small window—a rocket-propelled grenade was found there, and many spent cartridges. It is a strange place for a sharp shooter, safe and secure, but the view through a very narrow slit, is limited. Colonel Bogdanos’s opinion was that he could have shot towards the other side of the street, just to create general mayhem.” </font><br><br>There are many injuries that never fully heal, lingering like ghosts. This we know, as our lives are composed of plenty of partings. Many of us grew up in the shadow of conflict, with the consequences of war and its aftermaths being foundational to our existences. We traversed countless kilometers (as many as it took) to other cities in different countries to seek reprieve from incessant violence. We learned new languages, we built homes, we worked, we waited, we listened while you exclaimed with incredulity, <i>I cannot believe the news today!</i> It is pain that crosses lands and knows not of time. Burdened in one century and unburdened in the next, only to be re- burdened in the one after. Our lives are part of a long-term, collective reconciliation with no promise of cure. To this day, many of us have yet to return to where we began.<br><br>And what is a refusal to return, if not an open wound?<br><br><font color=\"#696969\">“12 April, Saturday: Mobs hit the museum again, taking the remaining chairs and tables, and smashing every office door with axes. Showcases in the galleries are smashed. All the cameras of Donny George, Research Director of the museum—his personal collection—are taken from his steel safe. He used them for museum purposes and thought they would be safer there than in his house. Filing cabinets are smashed.</font><br><br>The storerooms are ransacked by the mob; a third was only entered but left undamaged. Many objects are taken from these storerooms but the tally will not be known until the museum staff complete checking every object against the inventory. That will take many months as there are more than 170,000 objects with Iraq Museum (IM) numbers, as well as an immense collection for study purposes.”<br><br>We imagine what an injury looks like to a museum, a place that holds our secrets and our histories, or, as they are lesser known, our fraudulent, erroneous, and partisan pasts, the expressions and byproducts of cultural and political dominance that we rarely confront as our legacy. Before we consider the injury to the museum we must first acknowledge the injuries it has inflicted. These are houses of laurels, built on narratives that justify and concretize occupation and imperialism. Conquest, destruction, and pillaging are ingrained in institutionalized dispossession, and many museums—built by robber barons and sustained by their children and their children’s children— are keepers of the spoils of military superiority. <i>A mouthful of cavities.</i><br><br><font color=\"#696969\">“13 April, Sunday: The museum personnel return to work. The Director-General of Antiquities Dr Jabber and Donny George find the keys to the safe in the grounds of the museum. The mob is still milling around but they manage to drive them off the grounds. The museum restorer again asks the US troops stationed nearby to protect the museum– to no avail.”</font><br><br>Even still, we must reconcile with the reality that these spaces also have the capacity to heal, their restorative potential dissuading us from complete divestment. And some of these places themselves have endured monumental pain. Sixteen years ago, during the Invasion of Iraq, looters ransacked the National Museum in Baghdad. Pleas to U.S. forces to secure the building were ignored, and over the course of 36 hours thieves walked away with 15,000 objects, many of which were artifacts thousands of years old. Ritual vessels and busts, amulets and ivories, and sculptures of headless kings tumbled down the marble steps, later found in trunks of cars, wrapped in garbage bags, and dug up from backyards, only returned under the promise of amnesty. It was a place of protection left exposed, cavernous and bare.<br><br><font color=\"#696969\">“16 April, Wednesday: American tanks finally take up position in museum grounds. A few days later, two men come into the museum and return the Statue of the Assyrian King, Shalmaneser the Third, in three pieces, one of the Ubaid Reliefs and a few other items.”</font><br><br>ON FULLNESS<br><br>While some mourned this devastating plunder of “mankind’s heritage” from the “cradle of civilization,” others interpreted this loss more facetiously. At a press conference the day after the event, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld asked, “My goodness, were there that many vases? [Laughter.] Is it possible that there were that many vases in the whole country?” His glib response underscored the belief that the Iraqis are a civilization devoid of nice things and undeserving of them at the same time, justifying the rape of their history as the price paid for their “liberation.”<br><br><font color=\"#696969\">“Local mobs looted the museum between 10 and 13 April—the guard Muhsin left on 10 April when the situation became too dangerous. During those three days, somewhere between 6,000 and 10,000 objects went missing from the museum. Among them are some of the most famous objects in the collection–including the Warka head and the Ba Sidqi statue. It was discovered afterwards that the whole collection of seals had been taken too—that meant another 4,800 objects were missing. A lot more had been broken in the general mayhem of the looting.”</font><br><br>How do we determine fullness? 50 vases? 180? 1200? 750 but half are over 6,000 years old and all are heavier than 500 pounds? By the 171,000 objects that lived inside, above and underground, even if 30% were potentially fakes and only 53% were confirmed real and 17% were undecided? Is it by the 8,000 that went missing or the 7,000 that were returned? How do we even begin to measure what is lost to the cultural ether, perhaps never to be recuperated? And how do we quantify the value of stolen objects, the trophies of injury, that are cared for in perpetuity for our pleasure?<br><br>Perhaps we can accept fullness as a type of embodiment or animism, in which the materials we see—minerals, plants, and wood—are all charged with their previous lives, waiting to be roused. Or as variations on immensity and accumulation, where the dust collects and a heap of grass, clipped from decommissioned military sites, grows and sinks under its own weight. Or as an imperfect and porous memory cast across the room, permitting us to be disloyal to the real. How quickly our pictorial understanding of a place falls apart when  at planes are given forms and what is round is morphed into façade. We release ourselves from the obligation of authenticity and the expectation of authority. The curtain begins to bend beyond the edges of our recollection. We untie the lion from power.<br><br><font color=\"#696969\">“A steady trickle of returning objects has been taking place since Colonel Matthew Bogdanos declared a general amnesty for anyone who brings back an object. Therefore, at the time of publication, more than 2,500 objects have been returned, largely by people who live in the immediate neighborhood. They come to the museum and say, ‘I went in with the mob, and I took this to save it and here it is.’ The Warka Vase was returned, cracked but virtually intact. It is possible that some of the other important objects may resurface someday.”</font><br><br>ON GHOSTS<br><br>The process of healing can be an uneasy affair, as we are burdened not only by what it means to be liberated from pain but by what it means to be free at all. As stated by Rumsfeld, “Freedom’s untidy, and free people are free to make mistakes and commit crimes and do bad things. They’re also free to live their lives and do wonderful things. And that’s what’s going to happen here.” There goes that tinny drip, like a persistent pang.<br><br>Pillagers, plunderers, conquerors, pirates, looters, robbers, aren’t we all? Under the guise of care we possess, we control, we manage, we dominate, we colonize—these are the foundations of freedom. It has always been a one-sided negotiation. We are all complicit in the dispossession of land, in validating the circulation of objects that do not belong to us and continue to not belong to us, in knowingly and unknowingly oppressing others. To be free of pain we must first uncover a breed of freedom that is not dependent on the subjugation of others.<br><br>Until then, we are haunted.<br><br>***<br><br>It is possible there is no recovery from injury, as to ruin a life is to live amongst ruins. It means to <i>be</i> ruined. Our only option is to weather the pain.<br><br>But in this stark inevitability we are still reminded of the words of Rumi: <i>the wound is the place where the Light enters you.</i><br><br>There just may be wholes inside of these holes yet.<br><br><br>*<br><br><br>Abbas Akhavan’s practice ranges from site-specific ephemeral installations to drawing, video, sculpture and performance. The direction of his research has been deeply influenced by the specificity of the sites where he works: the architectures that house them, the economies that surround them, and the people that frequent them. The domestic sphere, as a forked space between hospitality and hostility, has been an ongoing area of research in his practice. More recent works have shifted focus, wandering onto spaces and species just outside the home – the garden, the backyard, and other domesticated landscapes.<br><br>Akhavan has had recent solo exhibitions at The Power Plant Contemporary Art Gallery, Toronto (2019), Vie D\'ange, Montréal (2018), and Museum Villa Stuck, Munich (2017). Group exhibitions include Liverpool Biennial, Liverpool (2018), SALT Galata, Istanbul (2017), Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York (2016), and Wellcome Collection, London (2016). Recently he was an artist-in-residence at Atelier Calder, Saché (2017), Fogo Island Arts, Fogo Island (2013, 2016, 2019), and Flora: ars+natura, Bogota (2015). Akhavan is the recipient of Kunstpreis Berlin (2012), The Abraaj Group Art Prize (2014), and the Sobey Art Award (2015).<br><br>*<br><br>Notes:<br>(1) All quotations are from a timetable of events excerpted from: Selma Al-Radi, “The Destruction of the Iraq National Museum,” <i>Museum International</i> vol. 55 (2003): 103-107.<br><br>Timetable of events excerpted from: Selma Al-Radi, “The Destruction of the Iraq National Museum,” <i>Museum International</i> vol. 55 (2003): 103-107.<br><br>*<br><br>Visit the exhibition <a href=\'/gallery/abbas-akhavan-cast-for-a-folly-2019\'>here</a>.<br><br>Download an PDF of the exhibition brochure <a href=\'https://wattis.org/media/02156.pdf\'>here</a>.<br>',''),(784,1,'2019-11-25 10:08:14','2020-01-30 05:22:23',60,'PUBLIC EVENT: A celebration of Mirage',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'public-event-a-celebration-of-mirage',NULL,'2019-08-14 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,'',_binary 'Originally started as <i>Mirage</i> in 1985, and reborn in 1992 as <i>Mirage #4 / Period[ical]</i>, Kevin Killian\'s photocopied poetry zine ran for 17 years, before its demise in 2009.

These sculptures are tools.<br><br>Some artists begin with an idea or an opinion, and use it to make an artwork—first comes the meaning, then comes the object. But for <a href=\'/gallery/vincent-fecteau-2019\'>Vincent Fecteau</a>, ideas never work. His sculptures don’t come as a result of an idea but are the tools he uses in his attempt to generate ideas and make meaning.<br><br>He begins with an initial impulse or desire (the specific trigger quickly becomes irrelevant) and proceeds by folding, cutting, twisting, trimming, adding, leveling, scraping off, smoothing out, carving away, turning over, twisting back, and adding again. He ties knots into other knots. Bit by bit, he locates the sharpest edges of whatever emerges—the parts of an object that cut into meaning in a way that makes ideas nervous or that puts them on alert. Eventually, each sculpture is wound up until it can’t be made any tighter, sharpened until it can’t be made any sharper, and it is released into the wild, perhaps to become a tool for other people as well.<br><br>2. These sculptures are abstract.<br><br>Everything is abstract. By which I mean—a thick sludge of matter, energies, and consciousness is all there really is, at the end of the day. And these sculptures are simply tools that try to access the abstract. They work at getting a bit closer to it, maybe even to stick their toes in it, to get dirty with it. Fecteau doesn’t invent an abstract form as much as he learns how to find one.<br><br>These sculptures don’t believe in distinguishing the abstract from the really real. Abstraction is not a chosen style or a composition but is deeply human—it’s about the lived experience of locating and co-existing with it. Any other artwork, be it a figurative painting or a realistic photograph, is just as abstract as Fecteau’s, only differently so.<br><br>That said, these sculptures aren’t anchored to the world by being connected to a recognizable topic, message, or, worse, an instruction for how to think or what to believe. Instead, they communicate by speaking a language art is particularly good at—that of arranged shapes, colors, textures, intuitions, and intentions. <i>I decided not to approach content directly, but to trust that it would follow me as I moved around the room. </i> (Fecteau).<br><br>3. These sculptures are made by Vincent Fecteau.<br><br>Fecteau grew up on Long Island, went to Wesleyan, studied painting, interned with Hannah Wilke for a summer, didn’t like New York that much. He took time off from college and moved to San Francisco in 1990 to work with ACT UP. He worked as a studio assistant to Nayland Blake for a few years, handpainted ceramics, and ended up as a florist. He had his first show in 1994, consisting mostly of photo-collages of cats. When Blake decamped for the East Coast, Fecteau took over his apartment and has been making his handcrafted sculptures ever since. When I asked him what he was reading these past few months, he mentioned <i>Now the Night Begins</i>, a novel written by the French filmmaker Alain Guiraudie (<i>Stranger by the Lake</i>). He lives near Balboa Park in the Mission Terrace neighborhood. There is a great painting by Tomma Abts in his kitchen. He bikes everywhere.<br><br>4. These sculptures are necessary.<br><br>Like practically any other work of art, these sculptures are made by someone who needs to make them. The question is not to ask <i>how</i> Fecteau makes them but <i>why</i> he makes them. The answer, always, is somewhat embarrassing or humiliating, since the sculptures end up saying more about the artist than anything else. They reveal too much, because all self-portraits reveal too much. In all they say about his achievements and capabilities, they say just as much about his limitations. They contain his secrets.<br><br>But these objects also embody the contradictions that all of us are: they appear calm yet agitated, exposed but also secretive, fully formed but still formless.<br><br>5. These sculptures are traps. <br><br>Vince sends me a Youtube link. It’s a talk by the artist Don Potts, from 1981.<br><br><i>You go to that feeling, you work on the trap, the trap sucks the feeling in, makes the feeling a little bit more concrete, you go back to the trap, you get rid of the junk, you build a more pure version, you go back to the feeling, and you just go back and forth. And over the course of the whole process, you start sucking this thing in, sucking this thing in—the trap is starting to catch it. (…) And then, one part of this trap becomes very important. No fussing around in this area. Other areas, you know, there’s some glue hanging off it, or maybe an inch too big, it’s not important. (…) What you’re trying to catch is something you’ve never had your hands on. It’s subtler than you can think, than your awareness can comprehend. So the trap has to be subtler than any trap you’ve ever made. You can’t use old trap-making techniques. It will just get you so far, but it won’t take you that last step, to catch that thing. So you’re all alone, well not all alone, mom is always around, [laughter], but you can’t go to history books, you can’t go to past work, you have to just respond to what it is you’re trying to catch. And it gets incredibly exciting. (…) At the last moment, when you put the last touches on the trap, something will happen. It’s not a trap anymore, it is what you’ve been trying to catch. This thing becomes that awareness or that idea, or whatever—you can’t talk about these things with words, you know. And there it is. And you look at it. And there have been times when I’ve just, you know, cried. Not, you know, going- to-lie-down-on-the-bed crying, [laughter] but emotion will just pour out of my eyes. </i>(Don Potts)<br><br>6. These sculptures are leaps of faith.<br><br>The painter Agnes Martin talked about <i>surrendering</i> the intellect. For many, to allow experience to precede cognition is a scary proposition. It puts us in a vulnerable place—walls need to be down, filters off. But what is art about if not vulnerability? Clicking back to Don Potts: <i>you need to be working right at that bottom edge of your nervous system. </i><br><br>Fecteau never draws and never makes preliminary sketches—he jumps right in. When he makes a cut into a shape, he can’t click undo but can only allow consequences to determine his next set of decisions. There is no safety net. It’s like when you delete that sentence you’ve become really attached to, even though you don’t yet know what will replace it. These sculptures don’t <i>know</i>, they <i>believe</i>. <br><br><i>These sculptures are made the way kids build backyard spaceships, with meticulous attention to detail, a grudging respect for the trash he works with, and no real hope of re-creating what he sees when he closes his eyes.</i> (Dennis Cooper)<br><br>7. These sculptures are new.<br><br>Even if they resemble others that came before it. They were made all at once, as a group, over the period of a year and a half. Decisions have migrated from one to another, making them siblings, of sorts—related but self-sufficient. They are made of carved foam, painted papier-mâché, and bits of resin clay. Some 3-D scanning and a 5-axis CNC router were also involved at one point in the process, which, for the artist, has been an experiment.<br><br>8. These sculptures are evidence.<br><br>These sculptures are the physical traces of a desire, an intention, or an impulse. They provide evidence of personal and material limitations. They capture the artist’s present state of mind, putting it on display for all to see. <br><br>They are also evidence of a battle between what is and what needs to be. They began on an open battlefield, where possibilities seemed endless. The material made a move, the artist made another, and art made yet another, each maneuvering itself away from, around, but also closer to the other. As they close in on each other, the decisions get smaller and smaller. The grip tightens. <br><br>To some of you, these sculptures will resonate, or strike a chord. They will prove that you share something with someone else. They are evidence that you are not alone.<br><br>9. These sculptures are here. <br><br>They sit on white pedestals, on display in a gallery. They claim space, perhaps even <i>compress</i> space. They are not models or surrogates for something else. They aren’t <i>also</i> elsewhere, the way images can be. <i>They exist in the world irreducibly and uncontainably</i> (Fecteau). Their job is to make manifest, in physical form, some of what is <i>not</i> here, or at least not visibly so—the psyche, the libido, and everything else that remains unsaid and unsayable.<br><br>Also here are photographs by <a href=\'https://www.greenenaftaligallery.com/artists/lutz-bacher/\' target=\'new\'>Lutz Bacher</a>. She and Fecteau have been friends for many years, often sharing ideas and inspirations. Sometimes, Fecteau would come across an object or a situation and would immediately know—<i>that’s a Lutz</i>. He would have to pull over or stop to take a picture, and send it to her. She would usually respond with an emoji or two. Years later, much to his delight, he would find out that she had turned the image or object into an artwork. Before she passed away, just a few months ago, the two artists had the idea of including some of those in this exhibition—works by Bacher that had originally been images Fecteau had found and sent her. They come back to him now, charged with life and friendship.<br><br>10. These sculptures are untouchable.<br><br>Which is ironic, because they were made by hand and consist of nothing other than the physical traces of the artist’s own touch. But these sculptures are untouchable in the way sound is untouchable—physically felt but impossible to actually hold on to. They look like what a polyrhythmic piece of music might look like, where many rhythms are made to intersect and overlap, even if they’re all happening at the same time, on top of each other.<br><br><i>I imagine an artwork as a fire that people gather around</i>, Fecteau once said. His sculptures are untouchable not because they might burn your hand but because the “art” in them is located in the energy they generate and in the emotions they mobilize. And, like the warmth of a fire or a melody, these sculptures can’t be photographed. Should you try, most of the object will be absent from the image—and that’s sculpture’s great advantage over other forms of art: it’s always hiding something. As Don Potts said about his traps, <i>if too much of the hook is exposed, the fish doesn’t bite.</i><br><br><br>P.S. These sculptures are not art.<br><br><i>Art is an ideal. It’s not an actual object. Objects can be evidence of an aspiration to “art,” but I think “art,” as a concept, is something bigger. It’s truth. It’s beyond museums and galleries and even artists. It’s out of our reach. How we use our limited means to try and approach this truth can be very moving.</i> (Fecteau)<br><br>*<br><br>The images above are different views and details of a single work: Vincent Fecteau, <i>Untitled</i>, 2006, papier-mâché, acrylic, 35 × 78 × 65 cm.

Jones recorded her version in 2004 in the midst of the George W. Bush presidency, restoring verses redacted from the original to reclaim the song’s social justice origins. She sings of private property and wealth disparity and names cities, states, and neighborhoods with majority Black populations that have been erased from the portrait of this land.<br><br>We listen to her mournful declaration and we think of the many ways in which we are bound together, to no land, to your land, and to our land.

Du Bois in his powerful 1903 work The Souls of Black Folk, double consciousness is described as a “sense of always looking at one’s self through the eyes of others, of measuring one’s soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity. One ever feels his twoness—an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.” It determines the experience of Black Americans negotiating selfhood in the face of discrimination and cultural location. An identity divided into multiple parts, with an impossibility for reconciliation (there is your land and then there is my land).<br><br>As a member of the first generation in her family to be born in the United States, Akosua Adoma Owusu speaks directly to the crisis of heritage and assimilation for African expatriates and their U.S.-born children in her work. She adds a third layer to Du Bois’s consciousness, expanding his definitions to reflect the diverse identities of African immigrants interacting in African, white American, and Black American culture. Although the internal pressures and external conflicts associated with double consciousness persist in Owusu’s third cinematic space, hers integrates what Du Bois excludes—feminism, queerness, and immigrant consciousnesses, and all their intersections. And it is in this in-between, amongst the archipelagoes, that she creates new meaning.<br><br>Owusu describes triple consciousness as experienced in: the necessary assimilation of the African diaspora to white American culture in order to succeed in American society; the frequent grouping of the African immigrant with Black Americans in the eyes of others, mostly due to a shared skin color; and the lack of connection of many Africans with African American culture and history, their distinct identities rendered marginal. Her films are materializations of this fragmentary space, where heterogeneity over singularity is currency. The work proposes that to be a we is to recognize a type of collectivity, or multiplicity in existence, one that can be simultaneously shared and fractured.<br><br>Combining documentary with personal narrative, Owusu’s films incorporate a diverse array of materials, including reenactments of folklore and scenes of daily life, animated textiles, archival and found footage, oral stories and semiautobiographical experiences, American pop culture and advertisements, and original 16mm and Super-8 film footage. These elements are mixed with a complex layering of sound and music that reflects her international perspective while delivering coded messages. I was wonderin’, if this land was made for you and me. The films overlap, crosscut, and splinter, doubling, tripling, and quadrupling their way into the contradictory and knotted terrains of globalization, transnational identities, and colonialism.<br><br>Owusu moves between imagined space and realism with an inherent ease, a nod to the avant-garde, experimental nature of Ghanaian films. Ghanaian filmmakers often traverse across genres, shifting from comedy to romance to horror in a single story, with no apparent allegiance to reality or formal narrative structure. Owusu adapts these strategies, using quick edits and unlikely juxtapositions to guide audiences through unsettling moments and to express the cultural anxieties surrounding her own racial legacy.<br><br>At the heart of many of her works is the fraught relationship between beauty and power. Black hair culture as an art form in postcolonial Ghana, colorism, and manifestations of racial capitalism in the beauty industry are frequent topics, as is the figure of the hairdresser and the subject of hairstyling. Of particular interest are the ways in which the ideology of beauty centers whiteness and functions as a hegemonic system of control. Owusu illustrates the Black trauma that is a consequence of white standards of beauty through a manipulation of film and a use of imagery and sound that seem incongruous—darkness can coexist with humor on this island, absolutely—while pointing to the absurdity of these power structures.<br><br>A lyrical portrait of hair salons in Kumasi, Ghana, <i>Me Broni Ba</i> (2009) depicts the tangled legacy of European colonialism in Africa through images of women practicing hair braiding on discarded white baby dolls from the West. Unfolding through a series of vignettes, the film is set against a child’s story of migrating from Ghana to the United States (<i>we hear it is a cold land, with leafless trees and no bright lights, full of pink people with blonde hair</i>). The film uncovers the meaning behind the Akan term of endearment, <i>me broni ba</i>, an expression that can be heard when a mother refers to her child, or even a husband to his wife, acknowledging their subject of adoration as <i>me broni ba</i>, or “my white baby.” Lest we forget, whiteness is a continent in which we all reside.<br><br>While <i>Me Broni Ba</i> is concentrated in Ghana, Split Ends, <i>I Feel Wonderful</i> (2012) investigates the uniqueness of hair culture in the U.S. Based on an ABC news report from the 1970s about Afro hair culture in New York City, <i>Split Ends</i> weaves together a dense collage of found footage that references Blaxploitation flicks and kaleidoscopic psychedelia. The film is spliced with voiceovers from colonial narratives, organic sounds from salon environments, and a protest speech on resistance by political activist, author, and academic Angela Davis (herself a hair icon of the civil rights era). Overlaid with a funktastic soundtrack, Owusu draws attention to both the inherent pride and specific displeasure and suffering associated with grooming Black hair that is all too familiar to the Black diaspora.<br><br>The final film in Owusu’s hair trilogy, <i>White Afro</i> (2019), employs an archival instructional video produced by the educational department of the Barbers, Beauticians, and Allied Industries Association on how to offer curly perms or body waving services to their white clientele, ostensibly for financial gain. The training video is intermingled with Owusu’s mother’s experience working as a hairstylist at a predominantly white hair salon called Fantastic Sams in Alexandria, Virginia. Offering a rare perspective on the Afro hairstyle—as an unmistakable marker of Black collective power that becomes a desirable, and appropriated, aesthetic during liberation movements—the film also expands on the abilities of non-Black beauticians and barbers to wield their shops as spaces for political change.<br><br><i>Pelourinho: They Don’t Really Care About Us</i> (2019) opens with a letter from Du Bois to the U.S. Embassy of Brazil in 1927 concerning attitudes and discrimination towards Black American travelers, specifically a perceived policy of exclusion that discouraged their entry into the South American country. Pelourinho, the old historic centre of Salvador City, is the location of Owusu’s film as well as the site in which Spike Lee and Michael Jackson filmed Jackson’s controversial music video “They Don’t Care About Us” (1996). The vestiges of Jackson’s visit endure in the city, his likeness appearing in a number of bizarre, kitschy forms, such as an image of a young Jackson protectively holding a doll that resembles his post-plastic surgery adult self. The film implies, with melancholic irony, that there are sinister exceptions to exclusion, in which a Black person that aligns more closely with whiteness is not only granted permission and access, but can be a figure of everlasting celebration.<br><br><i>Oh, this land, this land is your land<br>Ah, this land, this land is my land<br>Yeah, this land your land</i> <br><br>What cultural loss occurs, when the you and the me are split in two? Or three? Or four? How do we emerge from a constant weight of realizations, of being twice as good, of accepting half as much, of not being of here and too much of there? And how do these chasms transform into spaces of becoming? According to Owusu, Blackness is fundamentally entangled with loss, displacement, and memory; it is a manifold existence. At the root of what she identifies as her “warring consciousness” is the anxiety that she is too Ghanaian for America, and too American for Ghana. A life lived on two cracked halves, in constant search of a<br>land she can actually call her own.<br><br>—Kim Nguyen<br><br>*<br><br><i>The countries that I inhabit spread out like stars, in archipelagoes.</i> <br><br>—Édouard Glissant, Traité du Tout-Monde<br><br><br>*<br><br>Akosua Adoma Owusu (b. 1984) is a Ghanaian-American filmmaker, producer, and cinematographer.

How to stay alive, to live longer, to be healthier, to be better, to sustain a moment or simply to survive it, to bring back what has disappeared inside, to somehow keep on, even when everything around you has slipped away. Death is the only promise that is always kept, and it surrounds us—at the abusive hands of the government and the police, by the machines and systems of our own invention, by the water that has depleted from our oceans and from our bodies. The earth is on fire, children are in cages, opioids are poisoning our towns, and the Amazon is turning to ash. Amidst it all, we may forget that we are still amongst the living.<br><br>One could argue that it is our proximity to death that helps us know life. The bleakness of this statement is not lost on us, but we are, after all, living in bleak times. Living is excruciatingly beautiful and violent, irrational and mundane. A bruised sonata. To be alive is to have <i>endured</i>.<br><br>It is unnecessary to state the multitude of events that have occurred in the last 400 days, never mind the last 400 months or 4000 years. We enter into this space with the acknowledgment that we are entrenched in a wave of political, economic, and environmental crises (here and everywhere), and social inequality is on the rise. Here, we recognize that to overturn an institution, to overturn a system, to overturn ourselves, we must surrender to an unbearable life. We are in agreement that we have seen the dead, and we know the dead, and as they encroach the gates, we make a choice to <i>live</i>.<br><br>& we understand that we are, first and foremost, a <i>we</i>.<br><br>Because rather than a statement, this place is a proposition for the living. One that is contingent on equal parts chaos and collectivity and intervention and disorder. Hierarchies of upstairs and downstairs, inside and outside, in the know and out of the know, are elided. Just as there is no beginning, there is no discernible end. There is no distinct outcome nor is there a creation of a <i>thing</i>. The act, as a process, is consigning ourselves to the unknown. There is no leader, no singular author, and no space for refusal. We participate because we can and because we <i>must</i>.<br><br>Under current rulership, law and order is apocalyptic and punishing. Instead of conceding to (or replicating a space of ) authority and control, here we yield to (or wield) the unexpected and the illogical. Will we be polite? Or kind? Incendiary? Absurd? Who will be lured by the promise of a platform or enthralled by the captive audience? Will moments of competitiveness be met with acts of generosity or escalation? What knowledge systems will be revealed and which will be upended? What coded messages can be delivered between a cadaver and a mortician or a marionette and the wife of a parliamentarian? And what becomes of us, when we leave the life of a hierophant to embody the poet?<br><br>Much has been discussed about the capacity for art to exist in a time of devastation and unrest, and what the expectations are for its utility. A number of these conversations carry a false air of escape; as if for many activism is optional, or that living is divorced from life. Or that there are two realms, one to contain our concerns and another to hold our thoughts. Cultural production <i>can</i> function as provocation—to alter the way we see and think, how we imagine, what we believe, and perhaps even change the way we are. But we can, however, also accept it as one of the dead.<br><br>Similar to this room, Oswald de Andrade’s 1937 play <i>A morta</i> (<i>The Dead Woman</i>) begins in a mostly empty space. The first scene unfolds in a darkened theater, with two characters on one side and another two sitting in the first row of the audience. As they recite their lines, they watch their own performances executed onstage by four large-scale, spectral, mute marionettes, propped on high thrones. A performance of a performance, an explicit split between actor and character. We are witness to a scene that may be a hospital vigil, a wake, an autopsy, or even the scene of a crime, a detail that never becomes clear. As the play unfolds, we learn that our protagonist, The Poet, has an urgent desire for a more immediate engagement with the world. Under the guidance of a peculiar cast of characters—including a Sleepwalking Nurse, Edgar Allen Poe’s vulture, a Precocious Tourist, and a Polyglot Police Officer—The Poet struggles with untangling himself from his lover Beatriz, a defiant corpse who refuses to stay dead.<br><br>The play coincided with a period of extreme political engagement for Andrade, a poet and polemicist who integrated his radical ideals into his artistic output. A central figure in the Brazilian modernism movement, Andrade is best known for his manifesto of Brazilian nationalism, <i>Manifesto Antropófago</i> (<i>Cannibal Manifesto</i>) (1928). He argued that the greatest strength of Brazil’s history was its penchant for “cannibalizing” other cultures, and urged the intellectual community to employ cannibalism to assert itself against European postcolonial cultural domination—incorporating, reappropriating, and regurgitating other cultures in order to forge a new identity for itself. Even though it spurned European models of art to champion local production, Brazilian modernism still proved elitist. It was a movement that shut out, suppressed, and exoticized the Indigenous and Black cultures of Brazil, premised on a problematic theory that it was necessary to <i>swallow the outside to produce the inside</i>.<br><br>Andrade saw in the theater the power to communicate to the masses, and it became the medium in which he explored art’s potential role in social change. <i>A morta</i> is as much a call for opposition to—and liberation from—existing societal structures as it is a cynical warning. Andrade implores artists to consider the political implications of their work, to release themselves from the “lyrical catacombs” shaped by a legacy of aestheticism, to locate a language rooted in the street rather than in spectacle. At the crux of this argument is the belief that this vernacular is established through collectivity over individualism, with The Poet, the artist of the play and its <i>heart</i>, designated as the “coordinator of all human action.” Artistic work, to be revived from the dead, must be imbued with a sense of political responsibility.<br><br>Andrade’s dead represents sterility of tradition and lack of movement, the canonized narratives that reinforce power and control in order to suppress protest and revolution. In this place, we can extend these definitions to consider the dead as all fundamentally violent systems—from the historical conventions of exclusion within our institutions to the state sanctioned racial gendered-colonial dominance that informs our existence. To the fascist regimes that have seized power across the globe, to mass incarceration, police brutality, and political corruption. To empire, occupation, and the heteropatriarchy. To the white walls of this room and the stolen land in which this building rests. The list of the dead is endless. We see it and we know it.<br><br>Living in and of itself is rebellion, and a messy one at that. It is persisting in the face of this world’s brutal obscenities and paradoxes, while subscribing to a praxis of resistance that is imaginative and generative, where the creation of community is foregrounded in the process of dismantling patriarchal and capitalist structures. It is an attempt at decentralizing space and experience and subverting current configurations of subjectivity and justice to commit to a radical repositioning of life itself. Futurity that is achieved through interruption and insurgence and living as a form of abolition.<br><br>We return to this stage, where the distance between audience and artist, artist and character, between street and spectacle, and sunrise and sunset is both fluid and hazy. A room as a cacophonous body, with organs that play, beat, and pulsate. Together, narratives are constructed and deconstructed, overlapped or severed, where the strictures of a judge grow into the song of a child. Where the notion of poet as man and muse as woman is rejected, where anger gives way to love, and love submits to grief. We imagine the fragile earth becoming sky or the sensation of ground transforming into water below our feet. If being closer to chaos and calamity is to understand our own mortality, then it is possible that if we were to pause, to be in silence, we may just stop breathing altogether.<br><br>So instead we stay here for awhile, and feel everything, in this room.<br>One more, next, another,<br>                  another<br>                        & another after that.<br><br>A continuous script for an unbearable life.<br><br><i>When death slips us by, life becomes wonderful.</i><br><br>*<br><br>Cinthia Marcelle (b. 1974, Belo Horizonte, Brazil) lives and works in São Paulo.

CCA\'s Curatorial Practice Program Class of 2019 presented<a href = \'/gallery/to-know-herself-2019\'> <i>To Know Herself</i></a>, an exhibition about the lesbian bar as a place for social and political change. We hosted <a href = \'/gallery/abbas-akhavan-cast-for-a-folly-2019\'>Abbas Akhavan</a> as our 2019 Capp Street artist-in-residence, who spent four months in San Francisco, teaching at CCA, which culminated in a new site-specific installation. We worked with <a href = \'/gallery/akosua-adoma-owusu-welcome-to-the-jungle-2019\'>Akosua Adoma Owusu</a> as she imagined ways to install her \"hair trilogy\" films in a gallery context, in a show that then traveled to New Orleans. Our 2018 exhibition with <a href = \'https://archive1018.mudam.lu/en/expositions/details/exposition/adam-linder/\'>Adam Linder</a> also traveled, and opened at the Mudam, in Luxembourg, last spring. <a href = \'/gallery/vincent-fecteau-2019\'>Vincent Fecteau</a>, in his first hometown exhibition since 2002, showed an entirely new group of sculptures, and, adding an extra twist, included a few works by the late Lutz Bacher, a close friend. And as we write this, we are listening to a medley of songs, courtesy of <a href = \'/gallery/cinthia-marcelle-et-al-a-morta-2019-20\'>Cinthia Marcelle</a>, whose newly commissioned work transformed the gallery into an interactive radio station. <br><br>If you click on any of the artist names above, you\'ll find images as well as plenty of reviews in <i>Artforum, Art in America, Frieze, SF Chronicle, ArtAsiaPacific</i> and others.<br><br>[image3]<br>But in addition to being an exhibition venue, we also work with artists as a research institute: <a href = \'/on-our-mind/dodie-bellamy-is-on-our-mind-2018-2019\'>Dodie Bellamy</a> and <a href = \'/on-our-mind/trinh-t-minh-ha-is-on-our-mind-2019-2020\'>Trinh T.

Many of you returned to visit exhibitions or attend events, and many others discovered the Wattis for the first time. Our <a href = \'/thank-our-supporters\'>community of patrons</a> also grew, with new members bringing new ideas to our Leadership Circle and our Curator\'s Forum, and provided generous support. And after 5 years at the Wattis,<a href = \'https://artbma.org/documents/press/newsrelease_bmacontemporarycurators_final.pdf\'> Leila Grothe</a> became an associate curator at the Baltimore Museum of Art, and we welcomed Diego Villalobos to our team. <br><br>Our staff, visitors, and patrons made 2019 a great year for the Wattis.<br><br>[image6]<br>A donation, of any size, is one way to give back.

How to stay alive, to live longer, to be healthier, to be better, to sustain a moment or simply to survive it, to bring back what has disappeared inside, to somehow keep on, even when everything around you has slipped away. Death is the only promise that is always kept, and it surrounds us—at the abusive hands of the government and the police, by the machines and systems of our own invention, by the water that has depleted from our oceans and from our bodies. The earth is on fire, children are in cages, opioids are poisoning our towns, and the Amazon is turning to ash. Amidst it all, we may forget that we are still amongst the living.<br><br>One could argue that it is our proximity to death that helps us know life. The bleakness of this statement is not lost on us, but we are, after all, living in bleak times. Living is excruciatingly beautiful and violent, irrational and mundane. A bruised sonata. To be alive is to have <i>endured</i>.<br><br>It is unnecessary to state the multitude of events that have occurred in the last 400 days, never mind the last 400 months or 4000 years. We enter into this space with the acknowledgment that we are entrenched in a wave of political, economic, and environmental crises (here and everywhere), and social inequality is on the rise. Here, we recognize that to overturn an institution, to overturn a system, to overturn ourselves, we must surrender to an unbearable life. We are in agreement that we have seen the dead, and we know the dead, and as they encroach the gates, we make a choice to <i>live</i>.<br><br>& we understand that we are, first and foremost, a <i>we</i>.<br><br>Because rather than a statement, this place is a proposition for the living. One that is contingent on equal parts chaos and collectivity and intervention and disorder. Hierarchies of upstairs and downstairs, inside and outside, in the know and out of the know, are elided. Just as there is no beginning, there is no discernible end. There is no distinct outcome nor is there a creation of a <i>thing</i>. The act, as a process, is consigning ourselves to the unknown. There is no leader, no singular author, and no space for refusal. We participate because we can and because we <i>must</i>.<br><br>Under current rulership, law and order is apocalyptic and punishing. Instead of conceding to (or replicating a space of ) authority and control, here we yield to (or wield) the unexpected and the illogical. Will we be polite? Or kind? Incendiary? Absurd? Who will be lured by the promise of a platform or enthralled by the captive audience? Will moments of competitiveness be met with acts of generosity or escalation? What knowledge systems will be revealed and which will be upended? What coded messages can be delivered between a cadaver and a mortician or a marionette and the wife of a parliamentarian? And what becomes of us, when we leave the life of a hierophant to embody the poet?<br><br>Much has been discussed about the capacity for art to exist in a time of devastation and unrest, and what the expectations are for its utility. A number of these conversations carry a false air of escape; as if for many activism is optional, or that living is divorced from life. Or that there are two realms, one to contain our concerns and another to hold our thoughts. Cultural production <i>can</i> function as provocation—to alter the way we see and think, how we imagine, what we believe, and perhaps even change the way we are. But we can, however, also accept it as one of the dead.<br><br>Similar to this room, Oswald de Andrade’s 1937 play <i>A morta</i> (<i>The Dead Woman</i>) begins in a mostly empty space. The first scene unfolds in a darkened theater, with two characters on one side and another two sitting in the first row of the audience. As they recite their lines, they watch their own performances executed onstage by four large-scale, spectral, mute marionettes, propped on high thrones. A performance of a performance, an explicit split between actor and character. We are witness to a scene that may be a hospital vigil, a wake, an autopsy, or even the scene of a crime, a detail that never becomes clear. As the play unfolds, we learn that our protagonist, The Poet, has an urgent desire for a more immediate engagement with the world. Under the guidance of a peculiar cast of characters—including a Sleepwalking Nurse, Edgar Allen Poe’s vulture, a Precocious Tourist, and a Polyglot Police Officer—The Poet struggles with untangling himself from his lover Beatriz, a defiant corpse who refuses to stay dead.<br><br>The play coincided with a period of extreme political engagement for Andrade, a poet and polemicist who integrated his radical ideals into his artistic output. A central figure in the Brazilian modernism movement, Andrade is best known for his manifesto of Brazilian nationalism, <i>Manifesto Antropófago</i> (<i>Cannibal Manifesto</i>) (1928). He argued that the greatest strength of Brazil’s history was its penchant for “cannibalizing” other cultures, and urged the intellectual community to employ cannibalism to assert itself against European postcolonial cultural domination—incorporating, reappropriating, and regurgitating other cultures in order to forge a new identity for itself. Even though it spurned European models of art to champion local production, Brazilian modernism still proved elitist. It was a movement that shut out, suppressed, and exoticized the Indigenous and Black cultures of Brazil, premised on a problematic theory that it was necessary to <i>swallow the outside to produce the inside</i>.<br><br>Andrade saw in the theater the power to communicate to the masses, and it became the medium in which he explored art’s potential role in social change. <i>A morta</i> is as much a call for opposition to—and liberation from—existing societal structures as it is a cynical warning. Andrade implores artists to consider the political implications of their work, to release themselves from the “lyrical catacombs” shaped by a legacy of aestheticism, to locate a language rooted in the street rather than in spectacle. At the crux of this argument is the belief that this vernacular is established through collectivity over individualism, with The Poet, the artist of the play and its <i>heart</i>, designated as the “coordinator of all human action.” Artistic work, to be revived from the dead, must be imbued with a sense of political responsibility.<br><br>Andrade’s dead represents sterility of tradition and lack of movement, the canonized narratives that reinforce power and control in order to suppress protest and revolution. In this place, we can extend these definitions to consider the dead as all fundamentally violent systems—from the historical conventions of exclusion within our institutions to the state sanctioned racial gendered-colonial dominance that informs our existence. To the fascist regimes that have seized power across the globe, to mass incarceration, police brutality, and political corruption. To empire, occupation, and the heteropatriarchy. To the white walls of this room and the stolen land in which this building rests. The list of the dead is endless. We see it and we know it.<br><br>Living in and of itself is rebellion, and a messy one at that. It is persisting in the face of this world’s brutal obscenities and paradoxes, while subscribing to a praxis of resistance that is imaginative and generative, where the creation of community is foregrounded in the process of dismantling patriarchal and capitalist structures. It is an attempt at decentralizing space and experience and subverting current configurations of subjectivity and justice to commit to a radical repositioning of life itself. Futurity that is achieved through interruption and insurgence and living as a form of abolition.<br><br>We return to this stage, where the distance between audience and artist, artist and character, between street and spectacle, and sunrise and sunset is both fluid and hazy. A room as a cacophonous body, with organs that play, beat, and pulsate. Together, narratives are constructed and deconstructed, overlapped or severed, where the strictures of a judge grow into the song of a child. Where the notion of poet as man and muse as woman is rejected, where anger gives way to love, and love submits to grief. We imagine the fragile earth becoming sky or the sensation of ground transforming into water below our feet. If being closer to chaos and calamity is to understand our own mortality, then it is possible that if we were to pause, to be in silence, we may just stop breathing altogether.<br><br>So instead we stay here for awhile, and feel everything, in this room.<br>One more, next, another,<br>                  another<br>                        & another after that.<br><br>A continuous script for an unbearable life.<br><br><i>When death slips us by, life becomes wonderful.</i><br><br>*<br><br>Cinthia Marcelle (b. 1974, Belo Horizonte, Brazil) lives and works in São Paulo.

Or by scatting, like Ella Fitzgerald singing over a drum solo, <i>doht dee duht boh duht dee … bahp m deel yuyl doo ee</i>. It would be a text spoken in tongues. But then, I feel my pocket vibrate and ding and see that I received a text message from Lydia. It’s a picture of a 6,000 year old Cyprus tree, along with a message: <br><br><p style=\"text-align:right\"><i>I finally worked out what faith is.</i></p> <br>Part of me wants to stop right here. I’ve already said everything that needs to be said about this exhibition: it’s made of wordless speech and sounds, vibrating onto bodies, with a message from the artist about the Long Tail of the sacred. <br><br>The only way to respond to her message, I reasoned, was not to. Not via text, at least. The topic of faith is far too big, too old, and too loaded to get into, but in a broad and abstract sense, perhaps it’s what we need when we come face to face with the unintelligible. It’s what rushes to the rescue when we jump into a void, preventing the vertigo that comes with having no points of reference. It’s when <i>belief</i> becomes a basis and form of understanding—which can be comforting but also dangerous. Religion, for example, is one way to organize faith or belief around a certain set of principles and rituals. But beyond whichever ideas or explanations our beliefs might provide us, they are also <i>experiences</i>. Something happens to the body. <br><br>Lydia Ourahmane is interested in how belief is registered on the body, in the ways it is made <i>material</i>. Even if belief is a mental state, she asks, does it also have physical repercussions? How does faith or belief materialize, as it rushes through bodies? Does it leave a mark of where it’s been? And does it linger in empty buildings, like an echo, long after believers have left? What types of human belief systems has that Cyprus tree witnessed? <br><br>The title of her exhibition, صرخة شمسية <i>Solar Cry</i>, is borrowed from a short text by Georges Bataille where he describes the sun as the most abstract of all objects because it’s impossible to look at. As such, he claims, it represents all that is elevated and out of reach—the sacred. It turns out that Bataille also used many other words to describe the sacred: <i>impossible, inner experience, absence of God, peak experience, rapturous self-loss, altered state, silence</i>. If faith is what we turn to when faced with the unintelligible, the sacred is that sense of suspension that happens right before we do so. Religion might be there to provide answers, as is logic, science, morality, and so on, but the sacred is the stunned interrogation itself, the negative space that precedes and envelops all of those explanations. It can’t be performed because it’s always already there, and it can only ever be witnessed, never obtained. It’s experienced as a lack, an absence, a short pause, a skip in the record, and it reveals all the noise that is the human experience. <br><br><p style=\"text-align:right\"><i>Alain Badiou talks about an inaesthetics, about inserting a lack into an instance of plenitude,</i> I write back.</p><br>A Solar Cry, then, is one where silence is sovereign. It’s a cry that thickens all the interruptions and the intervals between sounds—the suspended part of the beat that makes the rhythm. It’s the gaps that open up between the grooves.  With this exhibition, Ourahmane harvests the space’s past and present silences, making them ready for visitors to witness. She creates a context where some of those sacred cries might be felt, even for a short moment, and where they can leave traces behind as they pass by. <br><br><p style=\"text-align:right\">Another ding and vibration. <i>I want to create a context that produces the potential for a miracle.</i></p><br>The artist’s own past has left its traces on her, obviously. For her, faith and belief contain the experience of war. She was born in Algeria, to parents who were active members of a Christian minority, and grew up near Oran, in a commune-like safe house her family ran. It was a place that welcomed fellow believers and recent converts, giving them a place to be together. At the same time, this act of gathering made them exposed and vulnerable to extremists who were fighting an authoritarian government in a brutal civil war that would last over a decade, with countless killed. In that context, to <i>believe</i> meant putting your body, your life, and your children’s lives in danger—as a member of a persecuted minority. Belief became a contestation of social, political, and military pressures, which squeezed those bodies into a vice, limiting or preventing their freedom of speech and movement. By necessity, people learned to live within the negative spaces. Even after the war ended, in 2002, the state prohibited any form of public gathering and it was only recently, in 2019, that the people began claiming physical space and occupying the streets. <br><br>Living through all of this has taught Ourahmane about different forms of escape and departure. She has learned to recognize, trust, and even foster the experience of negative space—<i>the unintelligible, the impossible, the absence of God, rapturous self-loss, silence, the sacred</i>. This can’t be articulated or arrived at via language or images because miracles are never ideas, at least not initially. They are always felt. They are material, like a bullet that hits a wall just inches away, or like an apple falling on Newton’s head. <br><br><p style=\"text-align:right\"><i>Ding. Bzzz.</i> This time, it’s a link to a PDF of “Who Touched Me?,” where Fred Moten tells Wu Tsang that all we are are instruments.</p><br>صرخة شمسية <i>Solar Cry</i> is an orchestra. In the main gallery, an opera singer sings with herself. There is speech but no words, as if a voice had been liberated from language and allowed to remain closer to breath, or as if a breath had been stopped before it could become language. Stacking the voices on top of each other creates a thickness, where what counts is their materiality, their weight in the room. The recordings can’t possibly be in synch, and yet, as they pile on top of each other, over time, they might find each other and open up small moments of synchronicity and resonance, like secret lovers. <br><br><p style=\"text-align:right\">Bzzzding. <i>I’m interested in how it’s possible to speak something into existence.</i></p><br><br>A few months before the exhibition, Ourahmane traveled to Tassili N’Ajjer, a plateau of rock valleys and formations in the Algerian Sahara desert, on the border with Libya and Mali, where 15,000 cave paintings date back 12,000 years. The experience of the desert, much like that of the sacred, cannot be articulated via language but can only be witnessed. Like the sacred, the desert is too big to see. Like the ocean, it, too, is inhospitable to humankind. It swallows presence. She went there to listen to its absence and to record its silence. <br><br>[image1][image2][image3][image4][image5][image6][image7][image8]<br><br>What she heard was the loud voicelessness of all that had passed through there. The cave paintings told the story of how the plateau was once full of people and lush with green. She learned that the area had once been a route for trade between Algeria and Niger, where fathers would sell their sons for the price of three kilos of salt—as the story goes. Today, people go there with metal detectors and search the sand for lost gold. Tassili N’Ajjer is also home to the Tuareg people, who inherited the knowledge of how to handle its harsh conditions. Ourahmane took a photograph of a Cyprus tree that somehow survives it all. <br><br>She embeds her experience into the gallery walls. Inspired by the marks still visible on the rocks after thousands of years—ones made by bodies who have defied being forgotten—she etches into the building, tagging a surface behind the gallery walls, and leaves behind a sign that will outlast the exhibition’s presence, like an echo. She installs transducer speakers (usually used for sound therapy) inside another wall, and her sub-decibel recordings of the desert make it vibrate with thousands of years of silence. Because one way to transmit the impossible scale of the desert—and the impossible scale of faith, belief, or the miraculous—is to give weight to its emptiness, to thicken its absences. <i>The beat becomes the buzz</i>, Fred tells Wu. <br><br><p style=\"text-align:right\">Bzzzz. Bzzzz. Bzzzz. I had set it to vibrate-only. A last one: <i>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQvcGVhJ334</i>, a lecture by Hypatia Vourloumis in Amsterdam — <i>We synchronize our tempos to find a rhythm through which the urge to live is expressed collectively. In this way, we set the world in motion, where poets can become the timekeepers of revolution.</i></p><br>Listening impacts the body. It implicates and <i>enlists</i> the body. Without being mediated by language, logic, or anything else, it touches the body and makes it move. As visitors to this exhibition, we vibrate together, like a chorus of instruments. Sounds and silences become pressure points, in a choreography of repetitions, for bodies to come up against the potential for something unintelligible. <br><br>*<br><br>Lydia Ourahmane (b. 1992, Saïda, Algeria) lives and works in Algiers.

The artist, spinning in slow motion, her face half-concealed from a long train of microbraids swirling around her head. Glowing beaded necklaces lift mid-air, surrounding her body like a tangle of lights or tracings of a coastline.<br><br>We hear a foreboding reharmonization of “Yankee Doodle,” a slow and ominous first pour into a gritty, bluesy glass by Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings. Jones belts a soulful and insistent protest, “This land is your land, this land is my land… <i>This</i> land was made for you and me.” This land. It was made for you, <i>and me</i>.<br><br>We know the song is a remake of Woody Guthrie’s “This Land is Your Land”— which was written as a subversive response to Irving Berlin’s “God Bless America”—a Marxist anthem often misconstrued as a folksy campfire singa- long. Jones recorded her version in 2004 in the midst of the George W. Bush presidency, restoring verses redacted from the original to reclaim the song’s social justice origins. She sings of private property and wealth disparity and names cities, states, and neighborhoods with majority Black populations that have been erased from the portrait of this land.<br><br>We listen to her mournful declaration and we think of the many ways in which we are bound together, to no land, to your land, and to our land. How we can have one foot on this land and one foot on another (and maybe even another, or two lands over top of each other). How once there was a land made for you and me, and then there wasn’t.<br><br>We feel the urgency throughout her vocals. They demand a <i>you</i> follow through on promises made for freedom and for a right to a home. A fervent call for us to believe that those who live in this country are the ones who should determine its destiny.<br><br>We recall that at no point do we hear her utter the word our, and only once we. There is the invitational you and an invitational me, somehow both oppositional and complementary, but always split in two.<br><br>A land cracked in half.<br><br>*<br><br>Coined by sociologist and civil rights activist W.E.B. Du Bois in his powerful 1903 work The Souls of Black Folk, double consciousness is described as a “sense of always looking at one’s self through the eyes of others, of measuring one’s soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity. One ever feels his twoness—an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.” It determines the experience of Black Americans negotiating selfhood in the face of discrimination and cultural location. An identity divided into multiple parts, with an impossibility for reconciliation (there is your land and then there is my land).<br><br>As a member of the first generation in her family to be born in the United States, Akosua Adoma Owusu speaks directly to the crisis of heritage and assimilation for African expatriates and their U.S.-born children in her work. She adds a third layer to Du Bois’s consciousness, expanding his definitions to reflect the diverse identities of African immigrants interacting in African, white American, and Black American culture. Although the internal pressures and external conflicts associated with double consciousness persist in Owusu’s third cinematic space, hers integrates what Du Bois excludes—feminism, queerness, and immigrant consciousnesses, and all their intersections. And it is in this in-between, amongst the archipelagoes, that she creates new meaning.<br><br>Owusu describes triple consciousness as experienced in: the necessary assimilation of the African diaspora to white American culture in order to succeed in American society; the frequent grouping of the African immigrant with Black Americans in the eyes of others, mostly due to a shared skin color; and the lack of connection of many Africans with African American culture and history, their distinct identities rendered marginal. Her films are materializations of this fragmentary space, where heterogeneity over singularity is currency. The work proposes that to be a we is to recognize a type of collectivity, or multiplicity in existence, one that can be simultaneously shared and fractured.<br><br>Combining documentary with personal narrative, Owusu’s films incorporate a diverse array of materials, including reenactments of folklore and scenes of daily life, animated textiles, archival and found footage, oral stories and semiautobiographical experiences, American pop culture and advertisements, and original 16mm and Super-8 film footage. These elements are mixed with a complex layering of sound and music that reflects her international perspective while delivering coded messages. I was wonderin’, if this land was made for you and me. The films overlap, crosscut, and splinter, doubling, tripling, and quadrupling their way into the contradictory and knotted terrains of globalization, transnational identities, and colonialism.<br><br>[image2]<br><br>Owusu moves between imagined space and realism with an inherent ease, a nod to the avant-garde, experimental nature of Ghanaian films. Ghanaian filmmakers often traverse across genres, shifting from comedy to romance to horror in a single story, with no apparent allegiance to reality or formal narrative structure. Owusu adapts these strategies, using quick edits and unlikely juxtapositions to guide audiences through unsettling moments and to express the cultural anxieties surrounding her own racial legacy.<br><br>At the heart of many of her works is the fraught relationship between beauty and power. Black hair culture as an art form in postcolonial Ghana, colorism, and manifestations of racial capitalism in the beauty industry are frequent topics, as is the figure of the hairdresser and the subject of hairstyling. Of particular interest are the ways in which the ideology of beauty centers whiteness and functions as a hegemonic system of control. Owusu illustrates the Black trauma that is a consequence of white standards of beauty through a manipulation of film and a use of imagery and sound that seem incongruous—darkness can coexist with humor on this island, absolutely—while pointing to the absurdity of these power structures.<br><br>A lyrical portrait of hair salons in Kumasi, Ghana, <i>Me Broni Ba</i> (2009) depicts the tangled legacy of European colonialism in Africa through images of women practicing hair braiding on discarded white baby dolls from the West. Unfolding through a series of vignettes, the film is set against a child’s story of migrating from Ghana to the United States (<i>we hear it is a cold land, with leafless trees and no bright lights, full of pink people with blonde hair</i>). The film uncovers the meaning behind the Akan term of endearment, <i>me broni ba</i>, an expression that can be heard when a mother refers to her child, or even a husband to his wife, acknowledging their subject of adoration as <i>me broni ba</i>, or “my white baby.” Lest we forget, whiteness is a continent in which we all reside.<br><br>[image3]<br><br>While <i>Me Broni Ba</i> is concentrated in Ghana, Split Ends, <i>I Feel Wonderful</i> (2012) investigates the uniqueness of hair culture in the U.S. Based on an ABC news report from the 1970s about Afro hair culture in New York City, <i>Split Ends</i> weaves together a dense collage of found footage that references Blaxploitation flicks and kaleidoscopic psychedelia. The film is spliced with voiceovers from colonial narratives, organic sounds from salon environments, and a protest speech on resistance by political activist, author, and academic Angela Davis (herself a hair icon of the civil rights era). Overlaid with a funktastic soundtrack, Owusu draws attention to both the inherent pride and specific displeasure and suffering associated with grooming Black hair that is all too familiar to the Black diaspora.<br><br>The final film in Owusu’s hair trilogy, <i>White Afro</i> (2019), employs an archival instructional video produced by the educational department of the Barbers, Beauticians, and Allied Industries Association on how to offer curly perms or body waving services to their white clientele, ostensibly for financial gain. The training video is intermingled with Owusu’s mother’s experience working as a hairstylist at a predominantly white hair salon called Fantastic Sams in Alexandria, Virginia. Offering a rare perspective on the Afro hairstyle—as an unmistakable marker of Black collective power that becomes a desirable, and appropriated, aesthetic during liberation movements—the film also expands on the abilities of non-Black beauticians and barbers to wield their shops as spaces for political change.<br><br>[image4]<br><br><i>Pelourinho: They Don’t Really Care About Us</i> (2019) opens with a letter from Du Bois to the U.S. Embassy of Brazil in 1927 concerning attitudes and discrimination towards Black American travelers, specifically a perceived policy of exclusion that discouraged their entry into the South American country. Pelourinho, the old historic centre of Salvador City, is the location of Owusu’s film as well as the site in which Spike Lee and Michael Jackson filmed Jackson’s controversial music video “They Don’t Care About Us” (1996). The vestiges of Jackson’s visit endure in the city, his likeness appearing in a number of bizarre, kitschy forms, such as an image of a young Jackson protectively holding a doll that resembles his post-plastic surgery adult self. The film implies, with melancholic irony, that there are sinister exceptions to exclusion, in which a Black person that aligns more closely with whiteness is not only granted permission and access, but can be a figure of everlasting celebration.<br><br>[image5]<br><br><i>Oh, this land, this land is your land<br>Ah, this land, this land is my land<br>Yeah, this land your land</i> <br><br>What cultural loss occurs, when the you and the me are split in two? Or three? Or four? How do we emerge from a constant weight of realizations, of being twice as good, of accepting half as much, of not being of here and too much of there? And how do these chasms transform into spaces of becoming? According to Owusu, Blackness is fundamentally entangled with loss, displacement, and memory; it is a manifold existence. At the root of what she identifies as her “warring consciousness” is the anxiety that she is too Ghanaian for America, and too American for Ghana. A life lived on two cracked halves, in constant search of a<br>land she can actually call her own.<br><br>—Kim Nguyen<br><br>*<br><br><i>The countries that I inhabit spread out like stars, in archipelagoes.</i> <br><br>—Édouard Glissant, Traité du Tout-Monde<br><br><br>*<br><br>Akosua Adoma Owusu (b. 1984) is a Ghanaian-American filmmaker, producer, and cinematographer.

Can you talk to us a bit about the full installation of <i>Eulogy For The Dyke Bar</i>?<br><br>Macon Reed: Absolutely. <i>Eulogy For The Dyke Bar</i> has been going on since 2015 and this is maybe its fourth iteration. Each time it happens it\'s a little bit different based on the needs of the particulars of the community. I started thinking about this project when I was living in Chicago. I have this amazing queer community there, but very, very few women and very few bars that I could go to to meet other people like me.<br>      	      	<br>The only gay neighborhood in town was called Boystown and it felt really clear that that wasn\'t for me. I felt kind of isolated with that and I started talking to people. I realized that all around the country dyke bars have been closing en masse. Interestingly enough, the more a place is welcoming and supportive of its queer community, the less likely they are to have dyke bars, which is really interesting to me. <br><br>I started asking people, why do you think that is? And increasingly I heard all of these stereotypes come out about women not being as cruisey or sexual or not liking to party as much, and I joked about this at the opening the other night, but that, you know, they wanted to just stay home and pet their cats and drink tea, which I always say is a great thing to do. But it was a sense inherently, in a sort of essentialist notion, that people who might want to go to a dyke bar were very few. <br><br>And so I started thinking about that more, because some of my favorite feminist, queer people are giving me this as true. Am I the only one having this need, et cetera. <br><br>I started looking into the history more and I realized that, basically, a few factors come into it, but socioeconomic disparities between basically—it\'s hard to use the language, it\'s very binary in terms of the way you think about it. But in terms of men getting paid a certain amount and women getting paid a certain amount, when you have communities of people who are assigned to those genders, that disparity grows. <br><br>Historically women haven\'t had access to the funds for going out or participating in party culture or any of that in the same way. And then also gentrification hits women much harder. Of course, if you add in any other identities to that, intersecting, it just kind of grows exponentially. <br><br>When I started learning about that and the way that assimilation has played a role in this—because to an extent somebody joked at one of our events that you can go to Applebee\'s now and be gay and safe for the most part. So do you really need to go to the dyke bar? I\'m like, I hope Applebee\'s isn\'t our goal, you know?<br><br>But there is this quality that as it becomes more and more safe, these spaces don\'t feel as essential in a way to people, or they might not realize it, that they\'re going as much. But they still feel so important. So I thought, I need to build this whole project out. I\'m going to build a dyke bar to have the conversations that I need to have. <br><br>My role as an artist is to create a container or some sort of site for other people to bring whatever they have to offer. In this case, I build up the whole sculptural environment, build out the installation, invite people that I trust into the space to speak for various events, and then I usually disappear. If I have a question I\'m asking, it doesn\'t feel like I\'m the one to answer my own question. So I went ahead, I started building the dyke bar out. <br><br>Another thing that came up to me when I was having these conversations was how much the experience around sexuality and gender are really depended on people\'s age and generation. People had really different experiences. What I started doing was thinking about the project not only as something to talk about dyke bars and gentrification, but to also think about it as a space to bring older and younger queer people into the same room, to share space and share stories. Not necessarily even about the things that maybe are the issues that make people get upset with each other and not understand, but to just share space. <br><br>We had teenagers all the way to people into their late seventies and eighties listening to each other. People were crying and having all the feelings and I realized that that is also a really important part of the project. <br><br>YO: The installation includes a lot more elements than the ones we have in the room. Maybe you can walk us through it. What elements does the installation usually include?<br><br>MR: Yeah, absolutely. Usually the installation, again, shifts a little bit based on each space that it\'s in, but usually a sort of fully flushed out one includes a lot of the main things I thought about as being important in bar spaces. So as my research for this project, I got to go hang out at dyke bars a lot, which was really fun, and hear all these stories. <br><br>There are things, like the pool table was always sort of a center of drama and intrigue and showing off. I had a pool table in the center of the room and a full bar, a dart board, a bunch of paintings based on images from dyke bars past. And then I also had a full wall of archival images in each iteration that represent all sorts of different parts of dyke bar history. All of those things kind of come together. <br><br>Then on the front in the window, there\'s always a sign that says “Dyke Bar,” which I like thinking about too, because it\'s not only for the people who come into the space. All the people who walk by inherently have to take a minute. The fact that Dyke is sort of this reclaimed slur makes people have a double take. And at Pulse [Art Fair]—we did it at an art fair one time—it was interesting to see people who I think maybe were straight debating, can I come in and use this bar? Because it\'s the only bar at the art fair, people had to, so I saw a lot of people standing by the dyke bar sign, looking, wondering, and crossing in.<br>            	       	<br>Those are the main components, but usually there\'s also an element of programming, because the main work of the project ends up through conversations people have, either directly in the space or afterwards.<br><br>YO: The neon signs that are right behind us, so many people at the opening would take pictures with the neon signs. They really help bracket, or punctuate, the exhibition super well. If you could talk a little bit about the neon signs.<br><br>MR: Part of one of the things that I kept seeing in bars, especially divier bars, were these neon signs. Especially the first space where we had it, it was a scrappy space. Wayfarers Gallery. They\'re great. They\'re in Brooklyn. They\'re kind of off the beaten path and people might not know it\'s a gallery and I thought, how can we make this announcement into the neighborhood of what we\'re doing? I looked into it and found out I can make a neon sign and get that made. <br><br>It\'s always felt like it just does something to make that space between the art and real life. It walks that line, because people may or may not actually take the time to read that it\'s this dyke bar instead of just being a neon sign. It\'s a kind of advertisement out onto the street and it also holds the space a little bit I think, especially in San Francisco where we don\'t have these bars as much. It puts the idea that that can be here into the minds of passers-by.<br><br>YO: Can you talk a little bit about your choice to use the word “dyke.”<br><br>MR: Yeah, I\'m glad you asked this. One of the most important things for me about this project is that it can be something that is healing and inclusive and expansive for people in the various queer communities that I spend time with. From the beginning, I always knew dyke bars as dyke bars, so it was just, that\'s the thing that people casually call it. But also the term “dyke” as a reclaimed hate word at one point. It\'s been reclaimed for a long time, but I still think it has a sort of challenge to it. “Dyke” was, for a lot of people, a little bit of about like, fuck you, like a term that people use because it has an apparent feminist social critique in it.<br><br>That being said, there are also all of these divisions now around ideas of gender and who gets to be a dyke, who gets to be included in that. It was absolutely important to me that this project was as inclusive as possible and that anyone who identifies as a dyke feels welcome and safe at any of these projects. But also, some people maybe used to identify with the term dyke and don\'t anymore, but they still need to feel a part of the community and included. <br><br>It was really important to me that people feel an affinity with the term and particularly that trans women who identify as dykes know that this space is for them, because some of those generational, and also just persistent, fights have been very exclusive. That\'s why it felt important to use the term “dyke,” but then also on all of the information, the invites, everything, there was a little statement that said, we use the term “dyke” in the most expansive way possible. Anybody who feels like they should be here should be here.<br><br>YO: The archival images, you touched on how they change as the exhibition travels or in every iteration. Can you talk a little bit about this and the archival images framed here?<br><br>MR: I think it\'s always a little bit hard to choose which images to include or not. I tried to both make the conversation local and specific to the community that it\'s in and also connect it to the larger issues. It isn\'t just that dyke bars are gone in San Francisco—I think Jolene\'s [Bar and Restaurant] is one of the few places open—but that they\'re closing everywhere, at least in the U.S. and in a lot of other countries. It feels like you want to have images from here and also connect to those conversations. In this case, San Francisco has such an amazing history and archives available that it was pretty easy to find images from the area.<br>      	        	<br>When I choose the images, I\'ve worked with a number of different archives. Here, I got to work with the Lexington Club Archival Project, which is pretty incredible. I also worked a lot with the [Lesbian] Herstory Archives and both places had things from San Francisco. I was looking for a full array of images that could give people a sense of the history and some more recent times in these spaces. We have everything from Facebook posts from Lila [Thirkield] who used to own the Lexington about why she\'s closing to letters and ...<br>       	       	<br>A lot of people might not know who are younger especially that dyke bars used to have police come and raid them all the time. There were times in history when if you were in a dyke bar and you got caught in there, the cops take your picture, put it on the front of the newspaper, and you would lose your family and your life and your job and everything. <br><br>I was trying hard to find pictures of people in these spaces from a long time ago and mostly they just don\'t exist. But I did find flyers from when the police came and beat up customers at Peg\'s Place, which was here in San Francisco, the community trying to do outreach after that. We have flyers from the Duchess of New York. They were trying to be closed down after the police raid. And then some of the protests that happened at the Lexington around gentrification here more recently.<br>         	        	<br>So we have all of those and then party flyers from different events. There are also, like the big sign up there that says “Nanny\'s: A Place for Gay Women, Biological or Otherwise.” I appreciate it, because that was from the nineties and is early trans inclusive language that feels a little bit wonky now, but was really great to find in the archives. We have basically a combination of all of these images and some pictures of people inside the Lex. My sense is that people could come into this space. They\'re all printed in black-and-white, so you can\'t tell what era they\'re from. People might be able to piece together a story from all of those. <br><br>YO: Wonderful. How do you work with the archive usually? Do you start with a conversation?<br><br>MR: I\'m such an artist researcher, but not an official researcher. When I first started, most of my research started with conversations with community members, so I talked to so many people about these spaces, what they mean, asking them what I should look into, who I should talk to, where to go, and all that. <br><br>From there, I ended up learning about places like the Lesbian Herstory Archives in Brooklyn. When I went there, it was very informal. It\'s a big townhouse in Brooklyn, often staffed with these rad older dykes, sometimes younger people. They\'re doing the best they can with very little resources. Basically, I am going through giant folders that are marked “bar.” You don\'t know where any of it comes from. You\'re trying to figure it out. And then I end up having conversations with people about that. But really it\'s a community process. <br><br>I also ended up finding out about the Lexington Club Archival Project through those conversations and they have already done so much of the work. That\'s something I think is important is the collaborative nature of the project. It\'s not like I\'m doing everything from scratch. I\'m trying to pull together these resources from multiple communities, and give them credit for that. I\'m grateful for those images. <br><br>It\'s really an organic process and sometimes it\'s taken me a long time to know where an image actually came from, because it\'s stuffed away with something in pencil on it. So it\'s a process.<br><br>YO: Let\'s talk about the jukebox. Everyone who came to the exhibition during install or during the show had a lot of questions, because it\'s such an attractive piece and it also meets the body in a very interesting way. Can you talk a bit about this choice?<br><br>MR: For one, I love that people are so drawn to these objects. I think part of it is that the materials aren\'t clear. I work with mostly DIY cheap materials. Part of that is because that was all that I had for a long time. Part of it is that I really liked that through the process of building it up with the paper clay and the joint compound, you end up with this weird, uncooked ceramic quality to it. People don\'t know what it\'s made of. When people don\'t know what something is made of, it makes them sit with it a little bit longer. <br><br>The bright colors are pretty consistently part of my style. For a long time I didn\'t know how to answer the questions people inevitably wanted to ask, like What\'s up with these bright colors? Part of it is that I really like things that are so bright that they\'re almost aggressive, which I feel like these colors walk a line with. And at the same time they feel really accessible. People who maybe don\'t have much to do with art spaces, you know, when they see bright colors, I feel like often people [inaudible]... It grabs their attention. It pulls them in. So some of it\'s sort of about making the work not feel too untouchable and serious, the way art can. <br><br>And then also, there\'s just something that feels kind of like a little bit of like a fuck the patriarchy, with the bright colors that make you have a jolt and feel like, Oh, I\'m in my body. I have a body. I\'m an embodied being.<br><br>Historically, I didn\'t understand how much strong color within the Western art tradition for a long time has been associated with queerness and effeminacy and all sorts of things. There\'s a real tendency to want to use these strong colors in response to that.<br><br>...<br><br>YO: How do you think the installation changes every time it travels? I know it\'s shown in multiple different settings.<br><br>MR: The project does change. With each showing it\'s in a different venue and part of that is just inherently the shape and size changes, but also what that community needs changes. The first time I did it was at a really small venue in Brooklyn, an art venue. It didn\'t necessarily have tons of people who came to it regularly, but it was really accessible and easy to get my people into, not very alienating. The next time it happened was at Pulse Art Fair in New York, which was a fancy art fair. We had to do a lot to make it feel accessible. <br><br>It was $25 to get in so I worked with Pulse to make it so that it was free for the community to get in. It also suddenly was intermingling with a very hetero space. It wasn\'t all queer people. There was that moment of it being the only bar at the fair, so people who maybe would never walk into a space that said “dyke bar,” contending with that. It was a really different situation, so we did a lot to make it feel inclusive and accessible how we could. <br><br>But also it felt like this incredible opportunity to get this conversation and awareness about how gentrification is affecting queer women and adjacent communities into a more mainstream audience. A lot of conversations came out of that that were great.<br>        	<br>The next time it happened was at the University of Southern Maine. I worked with a professor, Wendy Chapkis, there, a Women\'s Studies professor. We had an amazing night of story-telling from people in the local Portland area. So some of the images from the archives then became about Portland. Really what I like to do with each place that it goes to, I ask the community what it would need, what it is talking about, and to bring it\'s people in. Because again, as an outsider, it\'s not necessarily my position to choose that. And here [at the CCA Wattis Institute], I feel like it\'s also interesting because this is the first time that it\'s been part of a show with another artist. I think Tammy Rae Carland is such a good fit.

Can you talk to us a bit about the full installation of <i>Eulogy For The Dyke Bar</i>?<br><br>Macon Reed: Absolutely. <i>Eulogy For The Dyke Bar</i> has been going on since 2015 and this is maybe its fourth iteration. Each time it happens it\'s a little bit different based on the needs of the particulars of the community. I started thinking about this project when I was living in Chicago. I have this amazing queer community there, but very, very few women and very few bars that I could go to to meet other people like me.<br>      	      	<br>The only gay neighborhood in town was called Boystown and it felt really clear that that wasn\'t for me. I felt kind of isolated with that and I started talking to people. I realized that all around the country dyke bars have been closing en masse. Interestingly enough, the more a place is welcoming and supportive of its queer community, the less likely they are to have dyke bars, which is really interesting to me. <br><br>I started asking people, why do you think that is? And increasingly I heard all of these stereotypes come out about women not being as cruisey or sexual or not liking to party as much, and I joked about this at the opening the other night, but that, you know, they wanted to just stay home and pet their cats and drink tea, which I always say is a great thing to do. But it was a sense inherently, in a sort of essentialist notion, that people who might want to go to a dyke bar were very few. <br><br>And so I started thinking about that more, because some of my favorite feminist, queer people are giving me this as true. Am I the only one having this need, et cetera. <br><br>I started looking into the history more and I realized that, basically, a few factors come into it, but socioeconomic disparities between basically—it\'s hard to use the language, it\'s very binary in terms of the way you think about it. But in terms of men getting paid a certain amount and women getting paid a certain amount, when you have communities of people who are assigned to those genders, that disparity grows. <br><br>Historically women haven\'t had access to the funds for going out or participating in party culture or any of that in the same way. And then also gentrification hits women much harder. Of course, if you add in any other identities to that, intersecting, it just kind of grows exponentially. <br><br>When I started learning about that and the way that assimilation has played a role in this—because to an extent somebody joked at one of our events that you can go to Applebee\'s now and be gay and safe for the most part. So do you really need to go to the dyke bar? I\'m like, I hope Applebee\'s isn\'t our goal, you know?<br><br>But there is this quality that as it becomes more and more safe, these spaces don\'t feel as essential in a way to people, or they might not realize it, that they\'re going as much. But they still feel so important. So I thought, I need to build this whole project out. I\'m going to build a dyke bar to have the conversations that I need to have. <br><br>My role as an artist is to create a container or some sort of site for other people to bring whatever they have to offer. In this case, I build up the whole sculptural environment, build out the installation, invite people that I trust into the space to speak for various events, and then I usually disappear. If I have a question I\'m asking, it doesn\'t feel like I\'m the one to answer my own question. So I went ahead, I started building the dyke bar out. <br><br>Another thing that came up to me when I was having these conversations was how much the experience around sexuality and gender are really depended on people\'s age and generation. People had really different experiences. What I started doing was thinking about the project not only as something to talk about dyke bars and gentrification, but to also think about it as a space to bring older and younger queer people into the same room, to share space and share stories. Not necessarily even about the things that maybe are the issues that make people get upset with each other and not understand, but to just share space. <br><br>We had teenagers all the way to people into their late seventies and eighties listening to each other. People were crying and having all the feelings and I realized that that is also a really important part of the project. <br><br>YO: The installation includes a lot more elements than the ones we have in the room. Maybe you can walk us through it. What elements does the installation usually include?<br><br>MR: Yeah, absolutely. Usually the installation, again, shifts a little bit based on each space that it\'s in, but usually a sort of fully flushed out one includes a lot of the main things I thought about as being important in bar spaces. So as my research for this project, I got to go hang out at dyke bars a lot, which was really fun, and hear all these stories. <br><br>There are things, like the pool table was always sort of a center of drama and intrigue and showing off. I had a pool table in the center of the room and a full bar, a dart board, a bunch of paintings based on images from dyke bars past. And then I also had a full wall of archival images in each iteration that represent all sorts of different parts of dyke bar history. All of those things kind of come together. <br><br>Then on the front in the window, there\'s always a sign that says “Dyke Bar,” which I like thinking about too, because it\'s not only for the people who come into the space. All the people who walk by inherently have to take a minute. The fact that Dyke is sort of this reclaimed slur makes people have a double take. And at Pulse [Art Fair]—we did it at an art fair one time—it was interesting to see people who I think maybe were straight debating, can I come in and use this bar? Because it\'s the only bar at the art fair, people had to, so I saw a lot of people standing by the dyke bar sign, looking, wondering, and crossing in.<br>            	       	<br>Those are the main components, but usually there\'s also an element of programming, because the main work of the project ends up through conversations people have, either directly in the space or afterwards.<br><br>YO: The neon signs that are right behind us, so many people at the opening would take pictures with the neon signs. They really help bracket, or punctuate, the exhibition super well. If you could talk a little bit about the neon signs.<br><br>MR: Part of one of the things that I kept seeing in bars, especially divier bars, were these neon signs. Especially the first space where we had it, it was a scrappy space. Wayfarers Gallery. They\'re great. They\'re in Brooklyn. They\'re kind of off the beaten path and people might not know it\'s a gallery and I thought, how can we make this announcement into the neighborhood of what we\'re doing? I looked into it and found out I can make a neon sign and get that made. <br><br>It\'s always felt like it just does something to make that space between the art and real life. It walks that line, because people may or may not actually take the time to read that it\'s this dyke bar instead of just being a neon sign. It\'s a kind of advertisement out onto the street and it also holds the space a little bit I think, especially in San Francisco where we don\'t have these bars as much. It puts the idea that that can be here into the minds of passers-by.<br><br>YO: Can you talk a little bit about your choice to use the word “dyke.”<br><br>MR: Yeah, I\'m glad you asked this. One of the most important things for me about this project is that it can be something that is healing and inclusive and expansive for people in the various queer communities that I spend time with. From the beginning, I always knew dyke bars as dyke bars, so it was just, that\'s the thing that people casually call it. But also the term “dyke” as a reclaimed hate word at one point. It\'s been reclaimed for a long time, but I still think it has a sort of challenge to it. “Dyke” was, for a lot of people, a little bit of about like, fuck you, like a term that people use because it has an apparent feminist social critique in it.<br><br>That being said, there are also all of these divisions now around ideas of gender and who gets to be a dyke, who gets to be included in that. It was absolutely important to me that this project was as inclusive as possible and that anyone who identifies as a dyke feels welcome and safe at any of these projects. But also, some people maybe used to identify with the term dyke and don\'t anymore, but they still need to feel a part of the community and included. <br><br>It was really important to me that people feel an affinity with the term and particularly that trans women who identify as dykes know that this space is for them, because some of those generational, and also just persistent, fights have been very exclusive. That\'s why it felt important to use the term “dyke,” but then also on all of the information, the invites, everything, there was a little statement that said, we use the term “dyke” in the most expansive way possible. Anybody who feels like they should be here should be here.<br><br>YO: The archival images, you touched on how they change as the exhibition travels or in every iteration. Can you talk a little bit about this and the archival images framed here?<br><br>MR: I think it\'s always a little bit hard to choose which images to include or not. I tried to both make the conversation local and specific to the community that it\'s in and also connect it to the larger issues. It isn\'t just that dyke bars are gone in San Francisco—I think Jolene\'s [Bar and Restaurant] is one of the few places open—but that they\'re closing everywhere, at least in the U.S. and in a lot of other countries. It feels like you want to have images from here and also connect to those conversations. In this case, San Francisco has such an amazing history and archives available that it was pretty easy to find images from the area.<br>      	        	<br>When I choose the images, I\'ve worked with a number of different archives. Here, I got to work with the Lexington Club Archival Project, which is pretty incredible. I also worked a lot with the [Lesbian] Herstory Archives and both places had things from San Francisco. I was looking for a full array of images that could give people a sense of the history and some more recent times in these spaces. We have everything from Facebook posts from Lila [Thirkield] who used to own the Lexington about why she\'s closing to letters and ...<br>       	       	<br>A lot of people might not know who are younger especially that dyke bars used to have police come and raid them all the time. There were times in history when if you were in a dyke bar and you got caught in there, the cops take your picture, put it on the front of the newspaper, and you would lose your family and your life and your job and everything. <br><br>I was trying hard to find pictures of people in these spaces from a long time ago and mostly they just don\'t exist. But I did find flyers from when the police came and beat up customers at Peg\'s Place, which was here in San Francisco, the community trying to do outreach after that. We have flyers from the Duchess of New York. They were trying to be closed down after the police raid. And then some of the protests that happened at the Lexington around gentrification here more recently.<br>         	        	<br>So we have all of those and then party flyers from different events. There are also, like the big sign up there that says “Nanny\'s: A Place for Gay Women, Biological or Otherwise.” I appreciate it, because that was from the nineties and is early trans inclusive language that feels a little bit wonky now, but was really great to find in the archives. We have basically a combination of all of these images and some pictures of people inside the Lex. My sense is that people could come into this space. They\'re all printed in black-and-white, so you can\'t tell what era they\'re from. People might be able to piece together a story from all of those. <br><br>YO: Wonderful. How do you work with the archive usually? Do you start with a conversation?<br><br>MR: I\'m such an artist researcher, but not an official researcher. When I first started, most of my research started with conversations with community members, so I talked to so many people about these spaces, what they mean, asking them what I should look into, who I should talk to, where to go, and all that. <br><br>From there, I ended up learning about places like the Lesbian Herstory Archives in Brooklyn. When I went there, it was very informal. It\'s a big townhouse in Brooklyn, often staffed with these rad older dykes, sometimes younger people. They\'re doing the best they can with very little resources. Basically, I am going through giant folders that are marked “bar.” You don\'t know where any of it comes from. You\'re trying to figure it out. And then I end up having conversations with people about that. But really it\'s a community process. <br><br>I also ended up finding out about the Lexington Club Archival Project through those conversations and they have already done so much of the work. That\'s something I think is important is the collaborative nature of the project. It\'s not like I\'m doing everything from scratch. I\'m trying to pull together these resources from multiple communities, and give them credit for that. I\'m grateful for those images. <br><br>It\'s really an organic process and sometimes it\'s taken me a long time to know where an image actually came from, because it\'s stuffed away with something in pencil on it. So it\'s a process.<br><br>YO: Let\'s talk about the jukebox. Everyone who came to the exhibition during install or during the show had a lot of questions, because it\'s such an attractive piece and it also meets the body in a very interesting way. Can you talk a bit about this choice?<br><br>MR: For one, I love that people are so drawn to these objects. I think part of it is that the materials aren\'t clear. I work with mostly DIY cheap materials. Part of that is because that was all that I had for a long time. Part of it is that I really liked that through the process of building it up with the paper clay and the joint compound, you end up with this weird, uncooked ceramic quality to it. People don\'t know what it\'s made of. When people don\'t know what something is made of, it makes them sit with it a little bit longer. <br><br>The bright colors are pretty consistently part of my style. For a long time I didn\'t know how to answer the questions people inevitably wanted to ask, like What\'s up with these bright colors? Part of it is that I really like things that are so bright that they\'re almost aggressive, which I feel like these colors walk a line with. And at the same time they feel really accessible. People who maybe don\'t have much to do with art spaces, you know, when they see bright colors, I feel like often people [inaudible]... It grabs their attention. It pulls them in. So some of it\'s sort of about making the work not feel too untouchable and serious, the way art can. <br><br>And then also, there\'s just something that feels kind of like a little bit of like a fuck the patriarchy, with the bright colors that make you have a jolt and feel like, Oh, I\'m in my body. I have a body. I\'m an embodied being.<br><br>Historically, I didn\'t understand how much strong color within the Western art tradition for a long time has been associated with queerness and effeminacy and all sorts of things. There\'s a real tendency to want to use these strong colors in response to that.<br><br>...<br><br>YO: How do you think the installation changes every time it travels? I know it\'s shown in multiple different settings.<br><br>MR: The project does change. With each showing it\'s in a different venue and part of that is just inherently the shape and size changes, but also what that community needs changes. The first time I did it was at a really small venue in Brooklyn, an art venue. It didn\'t necessarily have tons of people who came to it regularly, but it was really accessible and easy to get my people into, not very alienating. The next time it happened was at Pulse Art Fair in New York, which was a fancy art fair. We had to do a lot to make it feel accessible. <br><br>It was $25 to get in so I worked with Pulse to make it so that it was free for the community to get in. It also suddenly was intermingling with a very hetero space. It wasn\'t all queer people. There was that moment of it being the only bar at the fair, so people who maybe would never walk into a space that said “dyke bar,” contending with that. It was a really different situation, so we did a lot to make it feel inclusive and accessible how we could. <br><br>But also it felt like this incredible opportunity to get this conversation and awareness about how gentrification is affecting queer women and adjacent communities into a more mainstream audience. A lot of conversations came out of that that were great.<br>        	<br>The next time it happened was at the University of Southern Maine. I worked with a professor, Wendy Chapkis, there, a Women\'s Studies professor. We had an amazing night of story-telling from people in the local Portland area. So some of the images from the archives then became about Portland. Really what I like to do with each place that it goes to, I ask the community what it would need, what it is talking about, and to bring it\'s people in. Because again, as an outsider, it\'s not necessarily my position to choose that. And here [at the CCA Wattis Institute], I feel like it\'s also interesting because this is the first time that it\'s been part of a show with another artist. I think Tammy Rae Carland is such a good fit. I\'m excited to be included in a show with her.',''),(907,1,'2020-01-31 03:37:41','2020-01-31 03:38:27',NULL,'ESSAY: On <i>Cinthia Marcelle: A morta</i>\r\nby Kim Nguyen',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'essay-on-cinthia-marcelle-a-morta-by-kim-nguyen',NULL,'2019-11-26 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,'',_binary '<i>We are in the mixed ruins of a world.</i><br>—The Hierophant<br><br>A great deal of our existence is about a negotiation with death. How to stay alive, to live longer, to be healthier, to be better, to sustain a moment or simply to survive it, to bring back what has disappeared inside, to somehow keep on, even when everything around you has slipped away. Death is the only promise that is always kept, and it surrounds us—at the abusive hands of the government and the police, by the machines and systems of our own invention, by the water that has depleted from our oceans and from our bodies. The earth is on fire, children are in cages, opioids are poisoning our towns, and the Amazon is turning to ash. Amidst it all, we may forget that we are still amongst the living.<br><br>One could argue that it is our proximity to death that helps us know life. The bleakness of this statement is not lost on us, but we are, after all, living in bleak times. Living is excruciatingly beautiful and violent, irrational and mundane. A bruised sonata. To be alive is to have <i>endured</i>.<br><br>It is unnecessary to state the multitude of events that have occurred in the last 400 days, never mind the last 400 months or 4000 years. We enter into this space with the acknowledgment that we are entrenched in a wave of political, economic, and environmental crises (here and everywhere), and social inequality is on the rise. Here, we recognize that to overturn an institution, to overturn a system, to overturn ourselves, we must surrender to an unbearable life. We are in agreement that we have seen the dead, and we know the dead, and as they encroach the gates, we make a choice to <i>live</i>.<br><br>& we understand that we are, first and foremost, a <i>we</i>.<br><br>Because rather than a statement, this place is a proposition for the living. One that is contingent on equal parts chaos and collectivity and intervention and disorder. Hierarchies of upstairs and downstairs, inside and outside, in the know and out of the know, are elided. Just as there is no beginning, there is no discernible end. There is no distinct outcome nor is there a creation of a <i>thing</i>. The act, as a process, is consigning ourselves to the unknown. There is no leader, no singular author, and no space for refusal. We participate because we can and because we <i>must</i>.<br><br>Under current rulership, law and order is apocalyptic and punishing. Instead of conceding to (or replicating a space of ) authority and control, here we yield to (or wield) the unexpected and the illogical. Will we be polite? Or kind? Incendiary? Absurd? Who will be lured by the promise of a platform or enthralled by the captive audience? Will moments of competitiveness be met with acts of generosity or escalation? What knowledge systems will be revealed and which will be upended? What coded messages can be delivered between a cadaver and a mortician or a marionette and the wife of a parliamentarian? And what becomes of us, when we leave the life of a hierophant to embody the poet?<br><br>Much has been discussed about the capacity for art to exist in a time of devastation and unrest, and what the expectations are for its utility. A number of these conversations carry a false air of escape; as if for many activism is optional, or that living is divorced from life. Or that there are two realms, one to contain our concerns and another to hold our thoughts. Cultural production <i>can</i> function as provocation—to alter the way we see and think, how we imagine, what we believe, and perhaps even change the way we are. But we can, however, also accept it as one of the dead.<br><br>Similar to this room, Oswald de Andrade’s 1937 play <i>A morta</i> (<i>The Dead Woman</i>) begins in a mostly empty space. The first scene unfolds in a darkened theater, with two characters on one side and another two sitting in the first row of the audience. As they recite their lines, they watch their own performances executed onstage by four large-scale, spectral, mute marionettes, propped on high thrones. A performance of a performance, an explicit split between actor and character. We are witness to a scene that may be a hospital vigil, a wake, an autopsy, or even the scene of a crime, a detail that never becomes clear. As the play unfolds, we learn that our protagonist, The Poet, has an urgent desire for a more immediate engagement with the world. Under the guidance of a peculiar cast of characters—including a Sleepwalking Nurse, Edgar Allen Poe’s vulture, a Precocious Tourist, and a Polyglot Police Officer—The Poet struggles with untangling himself from his lover Beatriz, a defiant corpse who refuses to stay dead.<br><br>The play coincided with a period of extreme political engagement for Andrade, a poet and polemicist who integrated his radical ideals into his artistic output. A central figure in the Brazilian modernism movement, Andrade is best known for his manifesto of Brazilian nationalism, <i>Manifesto Antropófago</i> (<i>Cannibal Manifesto</i>) (1928). He argued that the greatest strength of Brazil’s history was its penchant for “cannibalizing” other cultures, and urged the intellectual community to employ cannibalism to assert itself against European postcolonial cultural domination—incorporating, reappropriating, and regurgitating other cultures in order to forge a new identity for itself. Even though it spurned European models of art to champion local production, Brazilian modernism still proved elitist. It was a movement that shut out, suppressed, and exoticized the Indigenous and Black cultures of Brazil, premised on a problematic theory that it was necessary to <i>swallow the outside to produce the inside</i>.<br><br>Andrade saw in the theater the power to communicate to the masses, and it became the medium in which he explored art’s potential role in social change. <i>A morta</i> is as much a call for opposition to—and liberation from—existing societal structures as it is a cynical warning. Andrade implores artists to consider the political implications of their work, to release themselves from the “lyrical catacombs” shaped by a legacy of aestheticism, to locate a language rooted in the street rather than in spectacle. At the crux of this argument is the belief that this vernacular is established through collectivity over individualism, with The Poet, the artist of the play and its <i>heart</i>, designated as the “coordinator of all human action.” Artistic work, to be revived from the dead, must be imbued with a sense of political responsibility.<br><br>Andrade’s dead represents sterility of tradition and lack of movement, the canonized narratives that reinforce power and control in order to suppress protest and revolution. In this place, we can extend these definitions to consider the dead as all fundamentally violent systems—from the historical conventions of exclusion within our institutions to the state sanctioned racial gendered-colonial dominance that informs our existence. To the fascist regimes that have seized power across the globe, to mass incarceration, police brutality, and political corruption. To empire, occupation, and the heteropatriarchy. To the white walls of this room and the stolen land in which this building rests. The list of the dead is endless. We see it and we know it.<br><br>Living in and of itself is rebellion, and a messy one at that. It is persisting in the face of this world’s brutal obscenities and paradoxes, while subscribing to a praxis of resistance that is imaginative and generative, where the creation of community is foregrounded in the process of dismantling patriarchal and capitalist structures. It is an attempt at decentralizing space and experience and subverting current configurations of subjectivity and justice to commit to a radical repositioning of life itself. Futurity that is achieved through interruption and insurgence and living as a form of abolition.<br><br>We return to this stage, where the distance between audience and artist, artist and character, between street and spectacle, and sunrise and sunset is both fluid and hazy. A room as a cacophonous body, with organs that play, beat, and pulsate. Together, narratives are constructed and deconstructed, overlapped or severed, where the strictures of a judge grow into the song of a child. Where the notion of poet as man and muse as woman is rejected, where anger gives way to love, and love submits to grief. We imagine the fragile earth becoming sky or the sensation of ground transforming into water below our feet. If being closer to chaos and calamity is to understand our own mortality, then it is possible that if we were to pause, to be in silence, we may just stop breathing altogether.<br><br>So instead we stay here for awhile, and feel everything, in this room.<br>One more, next, another,<br>                  another<br>                        & another after that.<br><br>A continuous script for an unbearable life.<br><br><i>When death slips us by, life becomes wonderful.</i><br><br>*<br><br>Cinthia Marcelle (b. 1974, Belo Horizonte, Brazil) lives and works in São Paulo.

Can you talk to us a bit about the full installation of <i>Eulogy For The Dyke Bar</i>?<br><br>Macon Reed: Absolutely. <i>Eulogy For The Dyke Bar</i> has been going on since 2015 and this is maybe its fourth iteration. Each time it happens it\'s a little bit different based on the needs of the particulars of the community. I started thinking about this project when I was living in Chicago. I have this amazing queer community there, but very, very few women and very few bars that I could go to to meet other people like me.<br>      	      	<br>The only gay neighborhood in town was called Boystown and it felt really clear that that wasn\'t for me. I felt kind of isolated with that and I started talking to people. I realized that all around the country dyke bars have been closing en masse. Interestingly enough, the more a place is welcoming and supportive of its queer community, the less likely they are to have dyke bars, which is really interesting to me. <br><br>I started asking people, why do you think that is? And increasingly I heard all of these stereotypes come out about women not being as cruisey or sexual or not liking to party as much, and I joked about this at the opening the other night, but that, you know, they wanted to just stay home and pet their cats and drink tea, which I always say is a great thing to do. But it was a sense inherently, in a sort of essentialist notion, that people who might want to go to a dyke bar were very few. <br><br>And so I started thinking about that more, because some of my favorite feminist, queer people are giving me this as true. Am I the only one having this need, et cetera. <br><br>I started looking into the history more and I realized that, basically, a few factors come into it, but socioeconomic disparities between basically—it\'s hard to use the language, it\'s very binary in terms of the way you think about it. But in terms of men getting paid a certain amount and women getting paid a certain amount, when you have communities of people who are assigned to those genders, that disparity grows. <br><br>Historically women haven\'t had access to the funds for going out or participating in party culture or any of that in the same way. And then also gentrification hits women much harder. Of course, if you add in any other identities to that, intersecting, it just kind of grows exponentially. <br><br>When I started learning about that and the way that assimilation has played a role in this—because to an extent somebody joked at one of our events that you can go to Applebee\'s now and be gay and safe for the most part. So do you really need to go to the dyke bar? I\'m like, I hope Applebee\'s isn\'t our goal, you know?<br><br>But there is this quality that as it becomes more and more safe, these spaces don\'t feel as essential in a way to people, or they might not realize it, that they\'re going as much. But they still feel so important. So I thought, I need to build this whole project out. I\'m going to build a dyke bar to have the conversations that I need to have. <br><br>My role as an artist is to create a container or some sort of site for other people to bring whatever they have to offer. In this case, I build up the whole sculptural environment, build out the installation, invite people that I trust into the space to speak for various events, and then I usually disappear. If I have a question I\'m asking, it doesn\'t feel like I\'m the one to answer my own question. So I went ahead, I started building the dyke bar out. <br><br>Another thing that came up to me when I was having these conversations was how much the experience around sexuality and gender are really depended on people\'s age and generation. People had really different experiences. What I started doing was thinking about the project not only as something to talk about dyke bars and gentrification, but to also think about it as a space to bring older and younger queer people into the same room, to share space and share stories. Not necessarily even about the things that maybe are the issues that make people get upset with each other and not understand, but to just share space. <br><br>We had teenagers all the way to people into their late seventies and eighties listening to each other. People were crying and having all the feelings and I realized that that is also a really important part of the project. <br><br>YO: The installation includes a lot more elements than the ones we have in the room. Maybe you can walk us through it. What elements does the installation usually include?<br><br>MR: Yeah, absolutely. Usually the installation, again, shifts a little bit based on each space that it\'s in, but usually a sort of fully flushed out one includes a lot of the main things I thought about as being important in bar spaces. So as my research for this project, I got to go hang out at dyke bars a lot, which was really fun, and hear all these stories. <br><br>There are things, like the pool table was always sort of a center of drama and intrigue and showing off. I had a pool table in the center of the room and a full bar, a dart board, a bunch of paintings based on images from dyke bars past. And then I also had a full wall of archival images in each iteration that represent all sorts of different parts of dyke bar history. All of those things kind of come together. <br><br>Then on the front in the window, there\'s always a sign that says “Dyke Bar,” which I like thinking about too, because it\'s not only for the people who come into the space. All the people who walk by inherently have to take a minute. The fact that Dyke is sort of this reclaimed slur makes people have a double take. And at Pulse [Art Fair]—we did it at an art fair one time—it was interesting to see people who I think maybe were straight debating, can I come in and use this bar? Because it\'s the only bar at the art fair, people had to, so I saw a lot of people standing by the dyke bar sign, looking, wondering, and crossing in.<br>            	       	<br>Those are the main components, but usually there\'s also an element of programming, because the main work of the project ends up through conversations people have, either directly in the space or afterwards.<br><br>YO: The neon signs that are right behind us, so many people at the opening would take pictures with the neon signs. They really help bracket, or punctuate, the exhibition super well. If you could talk a little bit about the neon signs.<br><br>MR: Part of one of the things that I kept seeing in bars, especially divier bars, were these neon signs. Especially the first space where we had it, it was a scrappy space. Wayfarers Gallery. They\'re great. They\'re in Brooklyn. They\'re kind of off the beaten path and people might not know it\'s a gallery and I thought, how can we make this announcement into the neighborhood of what we\'re doing? I looked into it and found out I can make a neon sign and get that made. <br><br>It\'s always felt like it just does something to make that space between the art and real life. It walks that line, because people may or may not actually take the time to read that it\'s this dyke bar instead of just being a neon sign. It\'s a kind of advertisement out onto the street and it also holds the space a little bit I think, especially in San Francisco where we don\'t have these bars as much. It puts the idea that that can be here into the minds of passers-by.<br><br>YO: Can you talk a little bit about your choice to use the word “dyke.”<br><br>MR: Yeah, I\'m glad you asked this. One of the most important things for me about this project is that it can be something that is healing and inclusive and expansive for people in the various queer communities that I spend time with. From the beginning, I always knew dyke bars as dyke bars, so it was just, that\'s the thing that people casually call it. But also the term “dyke” as a reclaimed hate word at one point. It\'s been reclaimed for a long time, but I still think it has a sort of challenge to it. “Dyke” was, for a lot of people, a little bit of about like, fuck you, like a term that people use because it has an apparent feminist social critique in it.<br><br>That being said, there are also all of these divisions now around ideas of gender and who gets to be a dyke, who gets to be included in that. It was absolutely important to me that this project was as inclusive as possible and that anyone who identifies as a dyke feels welcome and safe at any of these projects. But also, some people maybe used to identify with the term dyke and don\'t anymore, but they still need to feel a part of the community and included. <br><br>It was really important to me that people feel an affinity with the term and particularly that trans women who identify as dykes know that this space is for them, because some of those generational, and also just persistent, fights have been very exclusive. That\'s why it felt important to use the term “dyke,” but then also on all of the information, the invites, everything, there was a little statement that said, we use the term “dyke” in the most expansive way possible. Anybody who feels like they should be here should be here.<br><br>YO: The archival images, you touched on how they change as the exhibition travels or in every iteration. Can you talk a little bit about this and the archival images framed here?<br><br>MR: I think it\'s always a little bit hard to choose which images to include or not. I tried to both make the conversation local and specific to the community that it\'s in and also connect it to the larger issues. It isn\'t just that dyke bars are gone in San Francisco—I think Jolene\'s [Bar and Restaurant] is one of the few places open—but that they\'re closing everywhere, at least in the U.S. and in a lot of other countries. It feels like you want to have images from here and also connect to those conversations. In this case, San Francisco has such an amazing history and archives available that it was pretty easy to find images from the area.<br>      	        	<br>When I choose the images, I\'ve worked with a number of different archives. Here, I got to work with the Lexington Club Archival Project, which is pretty incredible. I also worked a lot with the [Lesbian] Herstory Archives and both places had things from San Francisco. I was looking for a full array of images that could give people a sense of the history and some more recent times in these spaces. We have everything from Facebook posts from Lila [Thirkield] who used to own the Lexington about why she\'s closing to letters and ...<br>       	       	<br>A lot of people might not know who are younger especially that dyke bars used to have police come and raid them all the time. There were times in history when if you were in a dyke bar and you got caught in there, the cops take your picture, put it on the front of the newspaper, and you would lose your family and your life and your job and everything. <br><br>I was trying hard to find pictures of people in these spaces from a long time ago and mostly they just don\'t exist. But I did find flyers from when the police came and beat up customers at Peg\'s Place, which was here in San Francisco, the community trying to do outreach after that. We have flyers from the Duchess of New York. They were trying to be closed down after the police raid. And then some of the protests that happened at the Lexington around gentrification here more recently.<br>         	        	<br>So we have all of those and then party flyers from different events. There are also, like the big sign up there that says “Nanny\'s: A Place for Gay Women, Biological or Otherwise.” I appreciate it, because that was from the nineties and is early trans inclusive language that feels a little bit wonky now, but was really great to find in the archives. We have basically a combination of all of these images and some pictures of people inside the Lex. My sense is that people could come into this space. They\'re all printed in black-and-white, so you can\'t tell what era they\'re from. People might be able to piece together a story from all of those. <br><br>YO: Wonderful. How do you work with the archive usually? Do you start with a conversation?<br><br>MR: I\'m such an artist researcher, but not an official researcher. When I first started, most of my research started with conversations with community members, so I talked to so many people about these spaces, what they mean, asking them what I should look into, who I should talk to, where to go, and all that. <br><br>From there, I ended up learning about places like the Lesbian Herstory Archives in Brooklyn. When I went there, it was very informal. It\'s a big townhouse in Brooklyn, often staffed with these rad older dykes, sometimes younger people. They\'re doing the best they can with very little resources. Basically, I am going through giant folders that are marked “bar.” You don\'t know where any of it comes from. You\'re trying to figure it out. And then I end up having conversations with people about that. But really it\'s a community process. <br><br>I also ended up finding out about the Lexington Club Archival Project through those conversations and they have already done so much of the work. That\'s something I think is important is the collaborative nature of the project. It\'s not like I\'m doing everything from scratch. I\'m trying to pull together these resources from multiple communities, and give them credit for that. I\'m grateful for those images. <br><br>It\'s really an organic process and sometimes it\'s taken me a long time to know where an image actually came from, because it\'s stuffed away with something in pencil on it. So it\'s a process.<br><br>YO: Let\'s talk about the jukebox. Everyone who came to the exhibition during install or during the show had a lot of questions, because it\'s such an attractive piece and it also meets the body in a very interesting way. Can you talk a bit about this choice?<br><br>MR: For one, I love that people are so drawn to these objects. I think part of it is that the materials aren\'t clear. I work with mostly DIY cheap materials. Part of that is because that was all that I had for a long time. Part of it is that I really liked that through the process of building it up with the paper clay and the joint compound, you end up with this weird, uncooked ceramic quality to it. People don\'t know what it\'s made of. When people don\'t know what something is made of, it makes them sit with it a little bit longer. <br><br>The bright colors are pretty consistently part of my style. For a long time I didn\'t know how to answer the questions people inevitably wanted to ask, like What\'s up with these bright colors? Part of it is that I really like things that are so bright that they\'re almost aggressive, which I feel like these colors walk a line with. And at the same time they feel really accessible. People who maybe don\'t have much to do with art spaces, you know, when they see bright colors, I feel like often people [inaudible]... It grabs their attention. It pulls them in. So some of it\'s sort of about making the work not feel too untouchable and serious, the way art can. <br><br>And then also, there\'s just something that feels kind of like a little bit of like a fuck the patriarchy, with the bright colors that make you have a jolt and feel like, Oh, I\'m in my body. I have a body. I\'m an embodied being.<br><br>Historically, I didn\'t understand how much strong color within the Western art tradition for a long time has been associated with queerness and effeminacy and all sorts of things. There\'s a real tendency to want to use these strong colors in response to that.<br><br>...<br><br>YO: How do you think the installation changes every time it travels? I know it\'s shown in multiple different settings.<br><br>MR: The project does change. With each showing it\'s in a different venue and part of that is just inherently the shape and size changes, but also what that community needs changes. The first time I did it was at a really small venue in Brooklyn, an art venue. It didn\'t necessarily have tons of people who came to it regularly, but it was really accessible and easy to get my people into, not very alienating. The next time it happened was at Pulse Art Fair in New York, which was a fancy art fair. We had to do a lot to make it feel accessible. <br><br>It was $25 to get in so I worked with Pulse to make it so that it was free for the community to get in. It also suddenly was intermingling with a very hetero space. It wasn\'t all queer people. There was that moment of it being the only bar at the fair, so people who maybe would never walk into a space that said “dyke bar,” contending with that. It was a really different situation, so we did a lot to make it feel inclusive and accessible how we could. <br><br>But also it felt like this incredible opportunity to get this conversation and awareness about how gentrification is affecting queer women and adjacent communities into a more mainstream audience. A lot of conversations came out of that that were great.<br>        	<br>The next time it happened was at the University of Southern Maine. I worked with a professor, Wendy Chapkis, there, a Women\'s Studies professor. We had an amazing night of story-telling from people in the local Portland area. So some of the images from the archives then became about Portland. Really what I like to do with each place that it goes to, I ask the community what it would need, what it is talking about, and to bring it\'s people in. Because again, as an outsider, it\'s not necessarily my position to choose that. And here [at the CCA Wattis Institute], I feel like it\'s also interesting because this is the first time that it\'s been part of a show with another artist. I think Tammy Rae Carland is such a good fit. I\'m excited to be included in a show with her.',''),(916,1,'2020-01-31 03:45:17','2020-02-04 02:36:25',4150,'On <i>Cinthia Marcelle: A morta</i>\r\nby Kim Nguyen',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'on-cinthia-marcelle-a-morta-by-kim-nguyen',NULL,'2019-11-26 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,'',_binary '<i>We are in the mixed ruins of a world.</i><br>—The Hierophant<br><br>A great deal of our existence is about a negotiation with death. How to stay alive, to live longer, to be healthier, to be better, to sustain a moment or simply to survive it, to bring back what has disappeared inside, to somehow keep on, even when everything around you has slipped away. Death is the only promise that is always kept, and it surrounds us—at the abusive hands of the government and the police, by the machines and systems of our own invention, by the water that has depleted from our oceans and from our bodies. The earth is on fire, children are in cages, opioids are poisoning our towns, and the Amazon is turning to ash. Amidst it all, we may forget that we are still amongst the living.<br><br>One could argue that it is our proximity to death that helps us know life. The bleakness of this statement is not lost on us, but we are, after all, living in bleak times. Living is excruciatingly beautiful and violent, irrational and mundane. A bruised sonata. To be alive is to have <i>endured</i>.<br><br>It is unnecessary to state the multitude of events that have occurred in the last 400 days, never mind the last 400 months or 4000 years. We enter into this space with the acknowledgment that we are entrenched in a wave of political, economic, and environmental crises (here and everywhere), and social inequality is on the rise. Here, we recognize that to overturn an institution, to overturn a system, to overturn ourselves, we must surrender to an unbearable life.

One that is contingent on equal parts chaos and collectivity and intervention and disorder. Hierarchies of upstairs and downstairs, inside and outside, in the know and out of the know, are elided. Just as there is no beginning, there is no discernible end. There is no distinct outcome nor is there a creation of a <i>thing</i>. The act, as a process, is consigning ourselves to the unknown.

Who will be lured by the promise of a platform or enthralled by the captive audience? Will moments of competitiveness be met with acts of generosity or escalation? What knowledge systems will be revealed and which will be upended? What coded messages can be delivered between a cadaver and a mortician or a marionette and the wife of a parliamentarian? And what becomes of us, when we leave the life of a hierophant to embody the poet?<br><br>Much has been discussed about the capacity for art to exist in a time of devastation and unrest, and what the expectations are for its utility. A number of these conversations carry a false air of escape; as if for many activism is optional, or that living is divorced from life. Or that there are two realms, one to contain our concerns and another to hold our thoughts. Cultural production <i>can</i> function as provocation—to alter the way we see and think, how we imagine, what we believe, and perhaps even change the way we are. But we can, however, also accept it as one of the dead.<br><br>Similar to this room, Oswald de Andrade’s 1937 play <i>A morta</i> (<i>The Dead Woman</i>) begins in a mostly empty space. The first scene unfolds in a darkened theater, with two characters on one side and another two sitting in the first row of the audience. As they recite their lines, they watch their own performances executed onstage by four large-scale, spectral, mute marionettes, propped on high thrones. A performance of a performance, an explicit split between actor and character. We are witness to a scene that may be a hospital vigil, a wake, an autopsy, or even the scene of a crime, a detail that never becomes clear. As the play unfolds, we learn that our protagonist, The Poet, has an urgent desire for a more immediate engagement with the world. Under the guidance of a peculiar cast of characters—including a Sleepwalking Nurse, Edgar Allen Poe’s vulture, a Precocious Tourist, and a Polyglot Police Officer—The Poet struggles with untangling himself from his lover Beatriz, a defiant corpse who refuses to stay dead.<br><br>The play coincided with a period of extreme political engagement for Andrade, a poet and polemicist who integrated his radical ideals into his artistic output. A central figure in the Brazilian modernism movement, Andrade is best known for his manifesto of Brazilian nationalism, <i>Manifesto Antropófago</i> (<i>Cannibal Manifesto</i>) (1928). He argued that the greatest strength of Brazil’s history was its penchant for “cannibalizing” other cultures, and urged the intellectual community to employ cannibalism to assert itself against European postcolonial cultural domination—incorporating, reappropriating, and regurgitating other cultures in order to forge a new identity for itself. Even though it spurned European models of art to champion local production, Brazilian modernism still proved elitist. It was a movement that shut out, suppressed, and exoticized the Indigenous and Black cultures of Brazil, premised on a problematic theory that it was necessary to <i>swallow the outside to produce the inside</i>.<br><br>Andrade saw in the theater the power to communicate to the masses, and it became the medium in which he explored art’s potential role in social change. <i>A morta</i> is as much a call for opposition to—and liberation from—existing societal structures as it is a cynical warning. Andrade implores artists to consider the political implications of their work, to release themselves from the “lyrical catacombs” shaped by a legacy of aestheticism, to locate a language rooted in the street rather than in spectacle. At the crux of this argument is the belief that this vernacular is established through collectivity over individualism, with The Poet, the artist of the play and its <i>heart</i>, designated as the “coordinator of all human action.” Artistic work, to be revived from the dead, must be imbued with a sense of political responsibility.<br><br>Andrade’s dead represents sterility of tradition and lack of movement, the canonized narratives that reinforce power and control in order to suppress protest and revolution. In this place, we can extend these definitions to consider the dead as all fundamentally violent systems—from the historical conventions of exclusion within our institutions to the state sanctioned racial gendered-colonial dominance that informs our existence. To the fascist regimes that have seized power across the globe, to mass incarceration, police brutality, and political corruption. To empire, occupation, and the heteropatriarchy. To the white walls of this room and the stolen land in which this building rests. The list of the dead is endless. We see it and we know it.<br><br>Living in and of itself is rebellion, and a messy one at that. It is persisting in the face of this world’s brutal obscenities and paradoxes, while subscribing to a praxis of resistance that is imaginative and generative, where the creation of community is foregrounded in the process of dismantling patriarchal and capitalist structures. It is an attempt at decentralizing space and experience and subverting current configurations of subjectivity and justice to commit to a radical repositioning of life itself. Futurity that is achieved through interruption and insurgence and living as a form of abolition.<br><br>We return to this stage, where the distance between audience and artist, artist and character, between street and spectacle, and sunrise and sunset is both fluid and hazy. A room as a cacophonous body, with organs that play, beat, and pulsate. Together, narratives are constructed and deconstructed, overlapped or severed, where the strictures of a judge grow into the song of a child. Where the notion of poet as man and muse as woman is rejected, where anger gives way to love, and love submits to grief. We imagine the fragile earth becoming sky or the sensation of ground transforming into water below our feet. If being closer to chaos and calamity is to understand our own mortality, then it is possible that if we were to pause, to be in silence, we may just stop breathing altogether.<br><br>So instead we stay here for awhile, and feel everything, in this room.<br>One more, next, another,<br>                  another<br>                        & another after that.<br><br>A continuous script for an unbearable life.<br><br><i>When death slips us by, life becomes wonderful.</i><br><br>*<br><br>Cinthia Marcelle (b. 1974, Belo Horizonte, Brazil) lives and works in São Paulo.

We know that the human body is comprised of multiple cavities that carry our insides, completing our bodies through their absence, never visible from the exterior. Cavities are markers of decay, gapes in the smooth enamel of our teeth, that allude to underlying breakdown. Some of us will lose ’em all (a mouthful of cavities, as the song goes). The list of tangible cavities is long— the orifice of a tree, the gap between our walls, underground caverns. Then there are the less perceptible ones, like nebulas, or the electromagnetic energy between the surface of the Earth and the inner edge of the upper atmosphere, <i>55 kilometers up</i>, or what lies beneath our disintegrating glaciers. A cavity itself is a falsehood, a hole inside a whole.<br><br><font color=\"#696969\">“8 April, Tuesday: The museum staff leave, Fedayeen, or members of a militia, take over the grounds of the museum and start shooting at US troops–the external walls of the museum are pitted with the impact of bullets. The staff tried to return to the museum but were unable to because of fighting in the area. There was also a sniper shooting from a second floor room in the museum.”</font><sup>1</sup><br><br>How do we define a cavity of time? It is all the space in between that gives shape to our existence. There’s coffee and thin cigarettes and walking and walking and sleeping too early and waking too late, going to the studio and not staying at the studio, there’s stretching and eating and more walking and more coffee, there are  ashes of guilt and trips to the chiropractor, storytelling and forgetting names, reading and forgetting names, considering the productive potential of neglect while admiring a blue winged bird, more walking, and more coffee. There is a lot of discussion about bad art and how to make bad art good art, there are beelines from one park to another, sewn together by attentive steps along sandy edges, it’s dancing alone, staying inside, a claustrophobia only cured by foliage and fauna. It is boredom, getting empty, feeling empty, being empty, working less, having less, being with less. Finding what is visible to be made invisible, what is left, what is lost, what we have, what we will never have again, what we cannot find, what we do not know, what belongs to whom, when what is from when remains undefined. When it is and it isn’t. Nothing and everything, a hole inside a whole.<br><br><font color=\"#696969\">“9 April, Wednesday: The statue of Saddam is pulled down (watched by millions of television viewers worldwide), perhaps providing a perfect cover for a heist. Two ‘armored personnel carriers’ were seen in the museum grounds by the local population who all seem to agree on that fact. A number of people went into the museum and stayed there ‘for two hours,’ according to the general estimate. They came out carrying many boxes and then left (there is no confirmation for this story from other sources). They apparently went in through the small side door of the museum for which they had a key (this door was still open on 10 April). The back door was also open– someone had forgotten to lock it.”</font><br><br>Cavity living involves a degree of slipperiness, in which the parameters of time feel hazy. It is unclear whether we are in now or then, in the way that we are uncertain if these vitrines possess anything inside of their cabinets (or if they are cabinets at all). Walls and pillars are hollowed out, an escape hatch is blocked, plywood has the contour of a gate but is cut like a  rame. Artifice is the vernacular, as told by this painting that is in fact a green portal, a futuristic form that indicates we may be elsewhere rather than here. The architecture, in its exposure and impairment, renders vulnerability and injury as much as absence and disappearance. We are in a beautiful and bruised sentiment.<br><br><font color=\"#696969\">“10 April, Thursday: Looting by the mob begins. Some people apparently went in through a small door which was open at the back of the museum. Later, the mob opened the small door near the main entrance and broke down the main door from the inside. Muhsin, the guard, tried to convince the American tank crew positioned nearby to come and protect the museum–they came once and drove off the looters but refused to remain, saying that ‘they had no orders to do so.’ Muhsin tried to chase away the mob, was frightened, left the museum and set off home.”</font><br><br>ON INJURY<br><br>On occasion we fail to remember the origin of a chronic injury. Or we recall with exactitude the moment of injury, but its manifestations have morphed into new, unrecognizable forms that feel disconnected from its provenance. Elbow pain, first associated with stress, can transform into intermittent spasms from overexertion, eventually making itself known as a pinprick of pain each time the humidity drops. There is a phantom injury that connects said elbow to your knee, inexplicably. It is all too familiar, a tingle, a veil of soreness, a well-trodden ache that functions like clockwork. What is true for the elbow and the knee is true for the heart and the head.<br><br><font color=\"#696969\">“11 April, Friday: Local mobs continue to loot the museum. The glass doors leading to the administrative offices are broken down by the mob, who go through and start pillaging the office furniture. Tables and chairs, computers, and other office equipment are hauled away. The curator’s safe was professionally drilled and opened, the salaries of the staff for the next two months were taken, as was her personal money—she had left it in the safe for safe-keeping. The keys of the museum were also taken from her safe.<br><br>A sharpshooter who had set up in a room on the second floor,  res at the US troops below through a small window—a rocket-propelled grenade was found there, and many spent cartridges. It is a strange place for a sharp shooter, safe and secure, but the view through a very narrow slit, is limited. Colonel Bogdanos’s opinion was that he could have shot towards the other side of the street, just to create general mayhem.” </font><br><br>There are many injuries that never fully heal, lingering like ghosts. This we know, as our lives are composed of plenty of partings. Many of us grew up in the shadow of conflict, with the consequences of war and its aftermaths being foundational to our existences. We traversed countless kilometers (as many as it took) to other cities in different countries to seek reprieve from incessant violence. We learned new languages, we built homes, we worked, we waited, we listened while you exclaimed with incredulity, <i>I cannot believe the news today!</i> It is pain that crosses lands and knows not of time. Burdened in one century and unburdened in the next, only to be re- burdened in the one after. Our lives are part of a long-term, collective reconciliation with no promise of cure. To this day, many of us have yet to return to where we began.<br><br>And what is a refusal to return, if not an open wound?<br><br><font color=\"#696969\">“12 April, Saturday: Mobs hit the museum again, taking the remaining chairs and tables, and smashing every office door with axes. Showcases in the galleries are smashed. All the cameras of Donny George, Research Director of the museum—his personal collection—are taken from his steel safe. He used them for museum purposes and thought they would be safer there than in his house. Filing cabinets are smashed.</font><br><br>The storerooms are ransacked by the mob; a third was only entered but left undamaged. Many objects are taken from these storerooms but the tally will not be known until the museum staff complete checking every object against the inventory. That will take many months as there are more than 170,000 objects with Iraq Museum (IM) numbers, as well as an immense collection for study purposes.”<br><br>We imagine what an injury looks like to a museum, a place that holds our secrets and our histories, or, as they are lesser known, our fraudulent, erroneous, and partisan pasts, the expressions and byproducts of cultural and political dominance that we rarely confront as our legacy. Before we consider the injury to the museum we must first acknowledge the injuries it has inflicted. These are houses of laurels, built on narratives that justify and concretize occupation and imperialism. Conquest, destruction, and pillaging are ingrained in institutionalized dispossession, and many museums—built by robber barons and sustained by their children and their children’s children— are keepers of the spoils of military superiority. <i>A mouthful of cavities.</i><br><br><font color=\"#696969\">“13 April, Sunday: The museum personnel return to work. The Director-General of Antiquities Dr Jabber and Donny George find the keys to the safe in the grounds of the museum. The mob is still milling around but they manage to drive them off the grounds. The museum restorer again asks the US troops stationed nearby to protect the museum– to no avail.”</font><br><br>Even still, we must reconcile with the reality that these spaces also have the capacity to heal, their restorative potential dissuading us from complete divestment. And some of these places themselves have endured monumental pain. Sixteen years ago, during the Invasion of Iraq, looters ransacked the National Museum in Baghdad. Pleas to U.S. forces to secure the building were ignored, and over the course of 36 hours thieves walked away with 15,000 objects, many of which were artifacts thousands of years old. Ritual vessels and busts, amulets and ivories, and sculptures of headless kings tumbled down the marble steps, later found in trunks of cars, wrapped in garbage bags, and dug up from backyards, only returned under the promise of amnesty. It was a place of protection left exposed, cavernous and bare.<br><br><font color=\"#696969\">“16 April, Wednesday: American tanks finally take up position in museum grounds. A few days later, two men come into the museum and return the Statue of the Assyrian King, Shalmaneser the Third, in three pieces, one of the Ubaid Reliefs and a few other items.”</font><br><br>ON FULLNESS<br><br>While some mourned this devastating plunder of “mankind’s heritage” from the “cradle of civilization,” others interpreted this loss more facetiously. At a press conference the day after the event, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld asked, “My goodness, were there that many vases? [Laughter.] Is it possible that there were that many vases in the whole country?” His glib response underscored the belief that the Iraqis are a civilization devoid of nice things and undeserving of them at the same time, justifying the rape of their history as the price paid for their “liberation.”<br><br><font color=\"#696969\">“Local mobs looted the museum between 10 and 13 April—the guard Muhsin left on 10 April when the situation became too dangerous. During those three days, somewhere between 6,000 and 10,000 objects went missing from the museum. Among them are some of the most famous objects in the collection–including the Warka head and the Ba Sidqi statue. It was discovered afterwards that the whole collection of seals had been taken too—that meant another 4,800 objects were missing. A lot more had been broken in the general mayhem of the looting.”</font><br><br>How do we determine fullness? 50 vases? 180? 1200? 750 but half are over 6,000 years old and all are heavier than 500 pounds? By the 171,000 objects that lived inside, above and underground, even if 30% were potentially fakes and only 53% were confirmed real and 17% were undecided? Is it by the 8,000 that went missing or the 7,000 that were returned? How do we even begin to measure what is lost to the cultural ether, perhaps never to be recuperated? And how do we quantify the value of stolen objects, the trophies of injury, that are cared for in perpetuity for our pleasure?<br><br>Perhaps we can accept fullness as a type of embodiment or animism, in which the materials we see—minerals, plants, and wood—are all charged with their previous lives, waiting to be roused. Or as variations on immensity and accumulation, where the dust collects and a heap of grass, clipped from decommissioned military sites, grows and sinks under its own weight. Or as an imperfect and porous memory cast across the room, permitting us to be disloyal to the real. How quickly our pictorial understanding of a place falls apart when  at planes are given forms and what is round is morphed into façade. We release ourselves from the obligation of authenticity and the expectation of authority. The curtain begins to bend beyond the edges of our recollection. We untie the lion from power.<br><br><font color=\"#696969\">“A steady trickle of returning objects has been taking place since Colonel Matthew Bogdanos declared a general amnesty for anyone who brings back an object. Therefore, at the time of publication, more than 2,500 objects have been returned, largely by people who live in the immediate neighborhood. They come to the museum and say, ‘I went in with the mob, and I took this to save it and here it is.’ The Warka Vase was returned, cracked but virtually intact. It is possible that some of the other important objects may resurface someday.”</font><br><br>ON GHOSTS<br><br>The process of healing can be an uneasy affair, as we are burdened not only by what it means to be liberated from pain but by what it means to be free at all. As stated by Rumsfeld, “Freedom’s untidy, and free people are free to make mistakes and commit crimes and do bad things. They’re also free to live their lives and do wonderful things. And that’s what’s going to happen here.” There goes that tinny drip, like a persistent pang.<br><br>Pillagers, plunderers, conquerors, pirates, looters, robbers, aren’t we all? Under the guise of care we possess, we control, we manage, we dominate, we colonize—these are the foundations of freedom. It has always been a one-sided negotiation. We are all complicit in the dispossession of land, in validating the circulation of objects that do not belong to us and continue to not belong to us, in knowingly and unknowingly oppressing others. To be free of pain we must first uncover a breed of freedom that is not dependent on the subjugation of others.<br><br>Until then, we are haunted.<br><br>***<br><br>It is possible there is no recovery from injury, as to ruin a life is to live amongst ruins. It means to <i>be</i> ruined. Our only option is to weather the pain.<br><br>But in this stark inevitability we are still reminded of the words of Rumi: <i>the wound is the place where the Light enters you.</i><br><br>There just may be wholes inside of these holes yet.<br><br><br>*<br><br><br>Abbas Akhavan’s practice ranges from site-specific ephemeral installations to drawing, video, sculpture and performance.

Du Bois in his powerful 1903 work The Souls of Black Folk, double consciousness is described as a “sense of always looking at one’s self through the eyes of others, of measuring one’s soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity. One ever feels his twoness—an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.” It determines the experience of Black Americans negotiating selfhood in the face of discrimination and cultural location. An identity divided into multiple parts, with an impossibility for reconciliation (there is your land and then there is my land).<br><br>As a member of the first generation in her family to be born in the United States, Akosua Adoma Owusu speaks directly to the crisis of heritage and assimilation for African expatriates and their U.S.-born children in her work. She adds a third layer to Du Bois’s consciousness, expanding his definitions to reflect the diverse identities of African immigrants interacting in African, white American, and Black American culture. Although the internal pressures and external conflicts associated with double consciousness persist in Owusu’s third cinematic space, hers integrates what Du Bois excludes—feminism, queerness, and immigrant consciousnesses, and all their intersections. And it is in this in-between, amongst the archipelagoes, that she creates new meaning.<br><br>Owusu describes triple consciousness as experienced in: the necessary assimilation of the African diaspora to white American culture in order to succeed in American society; the frequent grouping of the African immigrant with Black Americans in the eyes of others, mostly due to a shared skin color; and the lack of connection of many Africans with African American culture and history, their distinct identities rendered marginal. Her films are materializations of this fragmentary space, where heterogeneity over singularity is currency. The work proposes that to be a we is to recognize a type of collectivity, or multiplicity in existence, one that can be simultaneously shared and fractured.<br><br>Combining documentary with personal narrative, Owusu’s films incorporate a diverse array of materials, including reenactments of folklore and scenes of daily life, animated textiles, archival and found footage, oral stories and semiautobiographical experiences, American pop culture and advertisements, and original 16mm and Super-8 film footage. These elements are mixed with a complex layering of sound and music that reflects her international perspective while delivering coded messages. I was wonderin’, if this land was made for you and me. The films overlap, crosscut, and splinter, doubling, tripling, and quadrupling their way into the contradictory and knotted terrains of globalization, transnational identities, and colonialism.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02606.jpg\'><br><br>Owusu moves between imagined space and realism with an inherent ease, a nod to the avant-garde, experimental nature of Ghanaian films. Ghanaian filmmakers often traverse across genres, shifting from comedy to romance to horror in a single story, with no apparent allegiance to reality or formal narrative structure. Owusu adapts these strategies, using quick edits and unlikely juxtapositions to guide audiences through unsettling moments and to express the cultural anxieties surrounding her own racial legacy.<br><br>At the heart of many of her works is the fraught relationship between beauty and power. Black hair culture as an art form in postcolonial Ghana, colorism, and manifestations of racial capitalism in the beauty industry are frequent topics, as is the figure of the hairdresser and the subject of hairstyling. Of particular interest are the ways in which the ideology of beauty centers whiteness and functions as a hegemonic system of control. Owusu illustrates the Black trauma that is a consequence of white standards of beauty through a manipulation of film and a use of imagery and sound that seem incongruous—darkness can coexist with humor on this island, absolutely—while pointing to the absurdity of these power structures.<br><br>A lyrical portrait of hair salons in Kumasi, Ghana, <i>Me Broni Ba</i> (2009) depicts the tangled legacy of European colonialism in Africa through images of women practicing hair braiding on discarded white baby dolls from the West. Unfolding through a series of vignettes, the film is set against a child’s story of migrating from Ghana to the United States (<i>we hear it is a cold land, with leafless trees and no bright lights, full of pink people with blonde hair</i>). The film uncovers the meaning behind the Akan term of endearment, <i>me broni ba</i>, an expression that can be heard when a mother refers to her child, or even a husband to his wife, acknowledging their subject of adoration as <i>me broni ba</i>, or “my white baby.” Lest we forget, whiteness is a continent in which we all reside.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02607.jpg\'><br><br>While <i>Me Broni Ba</i> is concentrated in Ghana, Split Ends, <i>I Feel Wonderful</i> (2012) investigates the uniqueness of hair culture in the U.S. Based on an ABC news report from the 1970s about Afro hair culture in New York City, <i>Split Ends</i> weaves together a dense collage of found footage that references Blaxploitation flicks and kaleidoscopic psychedelia. The film is spliced with voiceovers from colonial narratives, organic sounds from salon environments, and a protest speech on resistance by political activist, author, and academic Angela Davis (herself a hair icon of the civil rights era). Overlaid with a funktastic soundtrack, Owusu draws attention to both the inherent pride and specific displeasure and suffering associated with grooming Black hair that is all too familiar to the Black diaspora.<br><br>The final film in Owusu’s hair trilogy, <i>White Afro</i> (2019), employs an archival instructional video produced by the educational department of the Barbers, Beauticians, and Allied Industries Association on how to offer curly perms or body waving services to their white clientele, ostensibly for financial gain. The training video is intermingled with Owusu’s mother’s experience working as a hairstylist at a predominantly white hair salon called Fantastic Sams in Alexandria, Virginia. Offering a rare perspective on the Afro hairstyle—as an unmistakable marker of Black collective power that becomes a desirable, and appropriated, aesthetic during liberation movements—the film also expands on the abilities of non-Black beauticians and barbers to wield their shops as spaces for political change.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02608.jpg\'><br><br><i>Pelourinho: They Don’t Really Care About Us</i> (2019) opens with a letter from Du Bois to the U.S. Embassy of Brazil in 1927 concerning attitudes and discrimination towards Black American travelers, specifically a perceived policy of exclusion that discouraged their entry into the South American country. Pelourinho, the old historic centre of Salvador City, is the location of Owusu’s film as well as the site in which Spike Lee and Michael Jackson filmed Jackson’s controversial music video “They Don’t Care About Us” (1996). The vestiges of Jackson’s visit endure in the city, his likeness appearing in a number of bizarre, kitschy forms, such as an image of a young Jackson protectively holding a doll that resembles his post-plastic surgery adult self. The film implies, with melancholic irony, that there are sinister exceptions to exclusion, in which a Black person that aligns more closely with whiteness is not only granted permission and access, but can be a figure of everlasting celebration.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02609.jpg\'><br><br><i>Oh, this land, this land is your land<br>Ah, this land, this land is my land<br>Yeah, this land your land</i> <br><br>What cultural loss occurs, when the you and the me are split in two? Or three? Or four? How do we emerge from a constant weight of realizations, of being twice as good, of accepting half as much, of not being of here and too much of there? And how do these chasms transform into spaces of becoming? According to Owusu, Blackness is fundamentally entangled with loss, displacement, and memory; it is a manifold existence. At the root of what she identifies as her “warring consciousness” is the anxiety that she is too Ghanaian for America, and too American for Ghana. A life lived on two cracked halves, in constant search of a<br>land she can actually call her own.<br><br>*<br><br><i>The countries that I inhabit spread out like stars, in archipelagoes.</i> <br><br>—Édouard Glissant, Traité du Tout-Monde<br><br><br>*<br><br>Akosua Adoma Owusu (b. 1984) is a Ghanaian-American filmmaker, producer, and cinematographer.

Can you talk to us a bit about the full installation of <i>Eulogy For The Dyke Bar</i>?<br><br>Macon Reed: Absolutely. <i>Eulogy For The Dyke Bar</i> has been going on since 2015 and this is maybe its fourth iteration. Each time it happens it\'s a little bit different based on the needs of the particulars of the community. I started thinking about this project when I was living in Chicago. I have this amazing queer community there, but very, very few women and very few bars that I could go to to meet other people like me.<br>      	      	<br>The only gay neighborhood in town was called Boystown and it felt really clear that that wasn\'t for me. I felt kind of isolated with that and I started talking to people. I realized that all around the country dyke bars have been closing en masse. Interestingly enough, the more a place is welcoming and supportive of its queer community, the less likely they are to have dyke bars, which is really interesting to me. <br><br>I started asking people, why do you think that is? And increasingly I heard all of these stereotypes come out about women not being as cruisey or sexual or not liking to party as much, and I joked about this at the opening the other night, but that, you know, they wanted to just stay home and pet their cats and drink tea, which I always say is a great thing to do. But it was a sense inherently, in a sort of essentialist notion, that people who might want to go to a dyke bar were very few. <br><br>And so I started thinking about that more, because some of my favorite feminist, queer people are giving me this as true. Am I the only one having this need? Et cetera. <br><br>I started looking into the history more and I realized that, basically, a few factors come into it, but socioeconomic disparities between basically—it\'s hard to use the language, it\'s very binary in terms of the way you think about it. But in terms of men getting paid a certain amount and women getting paid a certain amount, when you have communities of people who are assigned to those genders, that disparity grows. <br><br>Historically women haven\'t had access to the funds for going out or participating in party culture or any of that in the same way. And then also gentrification hits women much harder. Of course, if you add in any other identities to that, intersecting, it just kind of grows exponentially. <br><br>When I started learning about that and the way that assimilation has played a role in this—because to an extent somebody joked at one of our events that you can go to Applebee\'s now and be gay and safe for the most part. So do you really need to go to the dyke bar? I\'m like, I hope Applebee\'s isn\'t our goal, you know?<br><br>But there is this quality that as it becomes more and more safe, these spaces don\'t feel as essential in a way to people, or they might not realize it, that they\'re going as much. But they still feel so important. So I thought, I need to build this whole project out. I\'m going to build a dyke bar to have the conversations that I need to have. <br><br>My role as an artist is to create a container or some sort of site for other people to bring whatever they have to offer. In this case, I build up the whole sculptural environment, build out the installation, invite people that I trust into the space to speak for various events, and then I usually disappear. If I have a question I\'m asking, it doesn\'t feel like I\'m the one to answer my own question. So I went ahead, I started building the dyke bar out. <br><br>Another thing that came up to me when I was having these conversations was how much the experience around sexuality and gender are really depended on people\'s age and generation. People had really different experiences. What I started doing was thinking about the project not only as something to talk about dyke bars and gentrification, but to also think about it as a space to bring older and younger queer people into the same room, to share space and share stories. Not necessarily even about the things that maybe are the issues that make people get upset with each other and not understand, but to just share space. <br><br>We had teenagers all the way to people into their late seventies and eighties listening to each other. People were crying and having all the feelings and I realized that that is also a really important part of the project. <br><br>YO: The installation includes a lot more elements than the ones we have in the room. Maybe you can walk us through it. What elements does the installation usually include?<br><br>MR: Yeah, absolutely. Usually the installation, again, shifts a little bit based on each space that it\'s in, but usually a sort of fully flushed out one includes a lot of the main things I thought about as being important in bar spaces. So as my research for this project, I got to go hang out at dyke bars a lot, which was really fun, and hear all these stories. <br><br>There are things, like the pool table was always sort of a center of drama and intrigue and showing off. I had a pool table in the center of the room and a full bar, a dart board, a bunch of paintings based on images from dyke bars past. And then I also had a full wall of archival images in each iteration that represent all sorts of different parts of dyke bar history. All of those things kind of come together. <br><br>Then on the front in the window, there\'s always a sign that says “Dyke Bar,” which I like thinking about too, because it\'s not only for the people who come into the space. All the people who walk by inherently have to take a minute. The fact that Dyke is sort of this reclaimed slur makes people have a double take. And at Pulse [Art Fair]—we did it at an art fair one time—it was interesting to see people, who I think maybe were straight, debating: Can I come in and use this bar? Because it\'s the only bar at the art fair, people had to, so I saw a lot of people standing by the dyke bar sign, looking, wondering, and crossing in.<br>            	       	<br>Those are the main components, but usually there\'s also an element of programming, because the main work of the project ends up through conversations people have, either directly in the space or afterwards.<br><br>YO: The neon signs that are right behind us, so many people at the opening would take pictures with the neon signs. They really help bracket, or punctuate, the exhibition super well. If you could talk a little bit about the neon signs.<br><br>MR: Part of one of the things that I kept seeing in bars, especially divier bars, were these neon signs. Especially the first space where we had it, it was a scrappy space. Wayfarers Gallery. They\'re great. They\'re in Brooklyn. They\'re kind of off the beaten path and people might not know it\'s a gallery and I thought, how can we make this announcement into the neighborhood of what we\'re doing? I looked into it and found out I can make a neon sign and get that made. <br><br>It\'s always felt like it just does something to make that space between the art and real life. It walks that line, because people may or may not actually take the time to read that it\'s this dyke bar instead of just being a neon sign. It\'s a kind of advertisement out onto the street and it also holds the space a little bit I think, especially in San Francisco where we don\'t have these bars as much. It puts the idea that that can be here into the minds of passers-by.<br><br>YO: Can you talk a little bit about your choice to use the word “dyke.”<br><br>MR: Yeah, I\'m glad you asked this. One of the most important things for me about this project is that it can be something that is healing and inclusive and expansive for people in the various queer communities that I spend time with. From the beginning, I always knew dyke bars as dyke bars, so it was just, that\'s the thing that people casually call it. But also the term “dyke” as a reclaimed hate word at one point. It\'s been reclaimed for a long time, but I still think it has a sort of challenge to it. “Dyke” was, for a lot of people, a little bit of about like, fuck you, like a term that people use because it has an apparent feminist social critique in it.<br><br>That being said, there are also all of these divisions now around ideas of gender and who gets to be a dyke, who gets to be included in that. It was absolutely important to me that this project was as inclusive as possible and that anyone who identifies as a dyke feels welcome and safe at any of these projects. But also, some people maybe used to identify with the term dyke and don\'t anymore, but they still need to feel a part of the community and included. <br><br>It was really important to me that people feel an affinity with the term and particularly that trans women who identify as dykes know that this space is for them, because some of those generational, and also just persistent, fights have been very exclusive. That\'s why it felt important to use the term “dyke,” but then also on all of the information, the invites, everything, there was a little statement that said, we use the term “dyke” in the most expansive way possible. Anybody who feels like they should be here should be here.<br><br>YO: The archival images, you touched on how they change as the exhibition travels or in every iteration. Can you talk a little bit about this and the archival images framed here?<br><br>MR: I think it\'s always a little bit hard to choose which images to include or not. I tried to both make the conversation local and specific to the community that it\'s in and also connect it to the larger issues. It isn\'t just that dyke bars are gone in San Francisco—I think Jolene\'s [Bar and Restaurant] is one of the few places open—but that they\'re closing everywhere, at least in the U.S. and in a lot of other countries. It feels like you want to have images from here and also connect to those conversations. In this case, San Francisco has such an amazing history and archives available that it was pretty easy to find images from the area.<br>      	        	<br>When I choose the images, I\'ve worked with a number of different archives. Here, I got to work with the Lexington Club Archival Project, which is pretty incredible. I also worked a lot with the [Lesbian] Herstory Archives and both places had things from San Francisco. I was looking for a full array of images that could give people a sense of the history and some more recent times in these spaces. We have everything from Facebook posts from Lila [Thirkield] who used to own the Lexington about why she\'s closing to letters and [other ephemera].<br>       	       	<br>A lot of people might not know who are younger especially that dyke bars used to have police come and raid them all the time. There were times in history when if you were in a dyke bar and you got caught in there, the cops take your picture, put it on the front of the newspaper, and you would lose your family and your life and your job and everything. <br><br>I was trying hard to find pictures of people in these spaces from a long time ago and mostly they just don\'t exist. But I did find flyers from when the police came and beat up customers at Peg\'s Place, which was here in San Francisco, the community trying to do outreach after that. We have flyers from the Duchess of New York. They were trying to be closed down after the police raid. And then some of the protests that happened at the Lexington around gentrification here more recently.<br>         	        	<br>So we have all of those and then party flyers from different events. There are also, like the big sign up there that says “Nanny\'s: A Place for Gay Women, Biological or Otherwise.” I appreciate it, because that was from the nineties and is early trans-inclusive language that feels a little bit wonky now, but was really great to find in the archives. We have basically a combination of all of these images and some pictures of people inside the Lex. My sense is that people could come into this space. They\'re all printed in black-and-white, so you can\'t tell what era they\'re from. People might be able to piece together a story from all of those. <br><br>YO: Wonderful. How do you work with the archive usually? Do you start with a conversation?<br><br>MR: I\'m such an artist-researcher, but not an official researcher. When I first started, most of my research started with conversations with community members, so I talked to so many people about these spaces, what they mean, asking them what I should look into, who I should talk to, where to go, and all that. <br><br>From there, I ended up learning about places like the Lesbian Herstory Archives in Brooklyn. When I went there, it was very informal. It\'s a big townhouse in Brooklyn, often staffed with these rad older dykes, sometimes younger people. They\'re doing the best they can with very little resources. Basically, I am going through giant folders that are marked “bar.” You don\'t know where any of it comes from. You\'re trying to figure it out. And then I end up having conversations with people about that. But really it\'s a community process. <br><br>I also ended up finding out about the Lexington Club Archival Project through those conversations and they have already done so much of the work. That\'s something I think is important is the collaborative nature of the project. It\'s not like I\'m doing everything from scratch. I\'m trying to pull together these resources from multiple communities, and give them credit for that. I\'m grateful for those images. <br><br>It\'s really an organic process and sometimes it\'s taken me a long time to know where an image actually came from, because it\'s stuffed away with something in pencil on it. So it\'s a process.<br><br>YO: Let\'s talk about the jukebox. Everyone who came to the exhibition during install or during the show had a lot of questions, because it\'s such an attractive piece and it also meets the body in a very interesting way. Can you talk a bit about this choice?<br><br>MR: For one, I love that people are so drawn to these objects. I think part of it is that the materials aren\'t clear. I work with mostly DIY cheap materials. Part of that is because that was all that I had for a long time. Part of it is that I really liked that through the process of building it up with the paper clay and the joint compound, you end up with this weird, uncooked ceramic quality to it. People don\'t know what it\'s made of. When people don\'t know what something is made of, it makes them sit with it a little bit longer. <br><br>The bright colors are pretty consistently part of my style. For a long time I didn\'t know how to answer the questions people inevitably wanted to ask, like, What\'s up with these bright colors? Part of it is that I really like things that are so bright that they\'re almost aggressive, which I feel like these colors walk a line with. And at the same time they feel really accessible. People who maybe don\'t have much to do with art spaces, you know, when they see bright colors, I feel like often ... it grabs their attention. It pulls them in. So some of it\'s sort of about making the work not feel too untouchable and serious, the way art can. <br><br>And then also, there\'s just something that feels kind of like a little bit of like a fuck the patriarchy, with the bright colors that make you have a jolt and feel like, Oh, I\'m in my body. I have a body. I\'m an embodied being.<br><br>Historically, I didn\'t understand how much strong color within the Western art tradition for a long time has been associated with queerness and effeminacy and all sorts of things. There\'s a real tendency to want to use these strong colors in response to that.<br><br>...<br><br>YO: How do you think the installation changes every time it travels? I know it\'s shown in multiple different settings.<br><br>MR: The project does change. With each showing it\'s in a different venue and part of that is just inherently the shape and size changes, but also what that community needs changes. The first time I did it was at a really small venue in Brooklyn, an art venue. It didn\'t necessarily have tons of people who came to it regularly, but it was really accessible and easy to get my people into, not very alienating. The next time it happened was at Pulse Art Fair in New York, which was a fancy art fair. We had to do a lot to make it feel accessible. <br><br>It was $25 to get in so I worked with Pulse to make it so that it was free for the community to get in. It also suddenly was intermingling with a very hetero space. It wasn\'t all queer people. There was that moment of it being the only bar at the fair, so people who maybe would never walk into a space that said “dyke bar,” contending with that. It was a really different situation, so we did a lot to make it feel inclusive and accessible how we could. <br><br>But also it felt like this incredible opportunity to get this conversation and awareness about how gentrification is affecting queer women and adjacent communities into a more mainstream audience. A lot of conversations came out of that that were great.<br>        	<br>The next time it happened was at the University of Southern Maine. I worked with a professor, Wendy Chapkis, there, a Women\'s Studies professor. We had an amazing night of story-telling from people in the local Portland area. So some of the images from the archives then became about Portland. Really what I like to do with each place that it goes to, I ask the community what it would need, what it is talking about, and to bring it\'s people in. Because again, as an outsider, it\'s not necessarily my position to choose that. And here [at the CCA Wattis Institute], I feel like it\'s also interesting because this is the first time that it\'s been part of a show with another artist. I think Tammy Rae Carland is such a good fit. I\'m excited to be included in a show with her.<br><br>*<br><br>Visit the exhibition <a href=\"/gallery/to-know-herself-2019\">here</a>.

The term often conjures drug-induced hallucinations, swirling black light posters, maybe a saccharine wistfulness for a mythical Summer of Love. But the psychedelic experience popularized in the late 1960s foregrounded a horrific war in Vietnam, and shocking political assassinations, and made prominent the realities of certain demographics whose potential was largely predetermined and restricted by race, gender, and class (not to imply that this has changed).<br><br>The psychedelic mindset represents an urge for personal freedom and detachment. It is not a stretch to imagine psychedelia, both then and now, as a countercultural escapism. One where opposition to the distinct norms and values of dominant society is a fleeting relief. One where an altered perception of time and space complicates the possibility of both experiencing and understanding what happens in the world. When the concept of psychedelia is applied to art, it can have a contradictory array of features: figurative or abstract, realist or fantastic, geometric or organic, static or kinetic. And yet despite these contradictions, a psychedelic sensibility persists as something specific and recognizable, even if its definition holds together dynamic oppositions. <br><br>Imagine the perspective of a small household spider, one that Rosha Yaghmai saw scampering across her tiled bathroom floor towards her jettisoned clothes as she stepped into the shower. She yanked the clothes away. The spider stopped, its landscape instantly erased. What does the spider think just happened?<br><br>Consider this a psychedelic experience.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02839.jpg\'><br><br>To empathize with a being outside of one’s self gives shape to our own boundaries and edges. It establishes recognition of something other than ourselves. But, going a step further, relocating one’s conscious experience in that of another being creates a narrative warped by intersubjectivity. Psychedelia is not simply understanding the feelings of another, it is an attempt to occupy the position of someone else (at least in a cerebral sense). It is psychically inhabiting<i>the stranger</i>, and in doing so, the baseline for strangeness becomes partially reconfigured. Art historian Lars Bang Larsen describes the psychedelic imagination as “oriented towards difference,” where one departs from existing conditions to explore:<br><br>the non-self, the elsewhere, and the next moment, in which one can attain another body (and be transformed into a bird, a molecule, or a stone), or connect to other temporality (crooked or spiraling time lines, deep pasts, and future worlds…). Through this, the radically foreign continues to act upon us by challenging the adequacy of our representations<sup>1</sup>. <br><br>Yaghmai’s interest in the slippage between being and observing the stranger is a personal one. Her father immigrated to the United States from Iran in the late 1960s, where he met and married her American mother. Yaghmai was born and raised in Santa Monica, California, where she was not explicitly taught Persian culture and history, and instead absorbed her heritage through her proximity to an immigrant pressured to assimilate. Yaghmai experiences this as a cultural amnesia of sorts, one where she is continually in a process of waking up to her own history. This outsider status is Yaghmai’s relationship to the psychedelic.<br><br>Anamnesis is the remembering of things from a supposed previous existence. This concept suggests that a human possesses innate knowledge and, according to Plato, learning is the process of uncovering that knowledge already within us. Perhaps this could explain Yaghmai’s frequent experience of taking unsuspecting interest in a topic or object only to find, after the fact, that it somehow has roots in Persian history. <br><br>Can a body inherit memory? Can history transfer implicitly through one’s genealogy? What is actually contained within the double helix of DNA?<br><br><img src=\'/media/02840.jpg\'><br><br>Perception has multiple modalities—sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch. To disrupt one’s experience of these can powerfully affect space and time. In this way, <i>Miraclegrow</i> is a supersized disruption,a mischievous <i>Honey I Shrunk the Kids</i> shift in scale and perception. Yaghmai’s magnification of a bathroom floor asks us to consider a new perspective, possibly one of a small spider. A 17-foot “hair,” fashioned from a bent, fused, rusted pipe, sits awaiting inspection. A castaway hair, an expended shred of biomaterial, carries evidence of unique genetic information, of past drug use, of cheap shampoo. It is an unnaturally close look at this particle of life. We see its scales, made from castings and detritus, reminiscent of sedimentary stone, tide pools, and the sand dunes of Mars. The hair reflects onto giant glossy tiles lining the walls, showing some undefined landscape in the process of disappearing or reappearing. It’s hard to tell which.<br><br>A bug zapper patiently waits, illuminating its surroundings with a forensic glow, promising mortality. Let’s hope reincarnation is real.<br><br>A collage of sounds and music emerges from a pipe embedded in the wall and wafts across the room, muffled and textural. One song, “Roodkhooneha” or “River Song,” originally performed by Persian singer Ramesh and re-recorded by Yaghmai and her brother, imagines pursuing a new life (or multiple lives) by embodying a fish and beginning the journey from the river to the sea.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02841.jpg\'><br><br>In this strange room, we become the stranger. <br><br>Philosopher Julia Kristeva puts it this way: “Every native feels [themselves] to be more or less a ‘foreigner’ in [their] ‘own and proper’ place, and that metaphorical value of the word ‘foreigner’ first leads the citizen to a feeling of discomfort as to [their] sexual, national, political, professional identity. Next it impels [them] to identify—sporadically, to be sure, but nonetheless intensely—with the other.”<sup>2</sup><br><br>We all incubate a stranger within ourselves. We’re all prone to imposter syndrome, it’s just a question of how deeply it’s buried within each of us.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02842.jpg\'><br><br>There are many things we don’t know about ourselves—things that feel strange to us once we notice them. Kristeva argues that our task is not “that of welcoming the foreigner within a system that obliterates [them] but of promoting the togetherness of those foreigners that we all recognize ourselves to be.”<sup>3</sup> By acknowledging this, the familiar and the foreign become fused. <br><br>What becomes of the border between oneself and others if oneself can also embody the other? This entangled margin is an unknowable space operating on a range of spheres from macro to micro. On an astrophysical level, cosmic dust is distributed by all objects in outer space, contaminated with evidence of its journey. On the molecular level, we transfer microscopic pieces of ourselves to everything we touch. Secondary transfer can occur with things we haven’t even touched. Perhaps reality should not be constrained by expectations of the self or of a recognizable “we.” Perhaps we should all imagine ourselves as the other, because we already are.<br><br>Notes<br><br>(1) Lars Bang Larsen, “One Proton at a Time.

San Francisco is a city that’s hard to avoid. It doesn’t recede into the background like some other metropolises.

I utilize its streets solely to go from one place to another. I barely have any leisure time to spend wandering around. Getting lost in a new city was simply a nonromantic inconvenience. <br><br>Then, in the summer of 2018, I got the chance to examine the city more <i>closely</i>, so to speak. I was offered a research position with the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) Public Knowledge Team, working on <i>Take Part</i>, a project that seeks to create a collective vision of the city of San Francisco. <i>Take Part</i> is organized by the Dutch artist duo Bik Van der Pol. In collaboration with the SF Public Library, <i>Take Part</i> exhibits a 41-by-37 ft. wood scale model of San Francisco. The model was first pitched by the San Francisco planning department to the federal Works Progress Administration, which commissioned its construction in 1938. It is a curious object, colorful and composed of pieces that fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. I spent three months over the summer carefully dusting it with an eclectic group of volunteers who know, and love, the city. I held Dolores Park between my hands and attempted to remove 60-year old dust off the playground. It was sensual and intimidating.<br><br>During the summer, we would meet every Friday with librarians from various SF Public Library branches to show them their neighborhood’s piece of the model and discuss the options for exhibiting and curating it. One of the most memorable conversations I had around the model was with Ramon Hernandez, the Mission Branch library manager. Hernandez was born in the Mission neighborhood; his parents met in the Mission and his grandparents were neighbors. As soon as he stood in front of the Mission piece of the model, the librarian began to point out the places that he knew. Given that the model was built around 1938, and the Mission has been severely gentrified ever since, I began to wonder about Hernandez’s familiarity with the city. How was it that a place could experience such hostile upheaval when its relatively unchanged cityscape, at a scale of 1 inch : 100 feet, lay so innocently before us? If not the map, then what had changed? <br><br>I began to look through books and talk to people to try and come up with an answer. I read Rebecca Solnit’s <i>Infinite City: A San Francisco Atlas</i> (2010).<sup>2</sup> The book examines different aspects of what constitutes a city by reinterpreting the form of the conventional atlas. I was most intrigued by the section titles. For example, “Monarchs and Queens” is a map of butterfly habitats and queer public spaces. Artist Mona Caron illustrated a map of the city juxtaposing butterfly species and spaces dedicated for members of the queer community. Putting together the various maps in Solnit’s <i>Atlas</i> with the model gave me a pretty good understanding of the city. What is missing on the model is the texture, the invisible changes that create hostility and force citizens to leave their homes, peacefully or not. <br><br>I believe citizens feel most connected to their city through small gatherings, friendships, and safe familiar spaces that hold them. I looked at the “Monarchs and Queens” map and laid it over the Mission, trying to trace what had changed. Almost all of the queer spaces around the city, in the Mission and elsewhere, have disappeared. While the narrative tends toward centering the AIDS epidemic and how it affected the queer scene, I was particularly curious about the lesbian scene. The reasons for this scene’s dissolution vary depending on who you ask, and some are more controversial than others. I became curious about the existing community, and what effect the disappearance of these spaces had had on them. <br><br>My exhibition was born from here. <i>To Know Herself</i> explores the lesbian bar as a place for social and political change. Once a thriving ground for queer culture, with numerous spaces where queer women gathered, today there is not a single bar in the city specifically for queer women. Maud’s, which operated from 1961 to ’89, and Amelia’s, which opened its doors in 1978 and closed in 1991, were two of the most popular and longest-running spaces, both owned by respected LGBTQ activist Rikki Streicher (1922–1994). More recently, The Lexington Club, a beloved lesbian dive bar and LGBTQ cultural landmark located in the Mission, closed its doors in 2015. This was the last remaining lesbian bar in San Francisco. Queer spots have since emerged in the city, but none have lasted as long or gathered as vibrant a community as any of the aforementioned bars.<br><br><i>To Know Herself</i> utilizes the bar in the CCA Wattis Institute’s event space in lieu of their gallery in order to study the different ways artists are thinking about lesbian bars and the impact of their disappearance—as well as possibilities for their eventual reconstruction. In a commissioned performance installation titled <i>Save the last dance for me</i> (2019), artist and CCA Provost Tammy Rae Carland invites visitors to dance to a three-minute song performed by Los Angeles–based musician Kelly Martin. The installation features this specially commissioned song on loop, with the music only audible when participants stand on a re-created dance floor. The work concludes each day with a special appearance by Carland to dance with an audience member. Some days, Carland asks an evening guest to share the last dance of the day with her as spectators are invited to watch. On other days, Carland appears alone in the space waiting for audiences to show up and share the last dance with her. <i>Save the last dance for me</i> is a visual and physical reminder of the power of music to pull people together in synchronicity, even for a fleeting three minutes.<br><br>For this Wattis presentation, artist Macon Reed presents her <i>Eulogy For The Dyke Bar</i> (2015) as a three-part installation featuring a jukebox, two neon signs, and twenty framed archival photographs from lesbian bars in San Francisco. The nonfunctional jukebox stands as a materialization of the familiar icon long associated with bringing people together. The neon sign reads “Dyke Bar,” not only pointing to the main subject of the show but also exuding a feeling of vibrancy and movement throughout the entire exhibition through the piece’s use of light and color. The framed archival photos call attention to the rich history of these spaces, in San Francisco and around the world, which demonstrate the value of convening queer communities in real time and space. While the reasons for the disappearance of these spaces in San Francisco range from rising real estate costs and shifting demographics to increasing reliance on technology as a social network, the disappearance of these physical spaces for the queer community remains an undeniable loss—a loss not just of a chapter in the city’s history but of all the affective interactions that these spaces enable. It is a loss of songs not sung, connections not made, dances not danced, and lovers not loved. <br><br>Ultimately, this exhibition examines the various ways in which a group of active citizens—namely, queer women—can connect with their city and feel empowered to change it, peacefully. Like Bassem, the character from In the <i>Last Days of the City</i>, I can’t say I wish this city and its inhabitants war, but I do wish for them an experience of the violent emotion and visceral investment of bygone times, when the determination and passion of queer communities fashioned the lasting character of this much-loved city.<br><br>*<br><br><img src=\'/media/02860.jpg\'><br><br><img src=\'/media/02861.jpg\'><br><br><img src=\'/media/02862.jpg\'><br><br><img src=\'/media/02863.jpg\'><br><br><img src=\'/media/02864.jpg\'><br><br><a href=\"\">History as Sanctuary Space</a><br>by Jenny Odell<br><br>In <i>The Gentrification of the Mind: Witness to a Lost Imagination</i>, writer Sarah Schulman gives a first-hand account of what happened to her neighborhood on the Lower East Side of New York City. Starting in the 1980s, children of suburban families that had been part of post–World War II white flight came back to fill the vacancies left by the dying, AIDS-affected queer community of which she was a part. What Schulman found was that the new residents had zero interest in learning about or having encounters with the dynamism of the neighborhood whose cultural destruction they were in fact hastening. In a description that feels all too familiar now, Schulman compares the businesses that catered to newcomers to “the hard currency kiosks in the Soviet Union that sold Marlboros to apparatchiks and tourists.”<sup>1</sup> And she suggests a connection between urban and psychological space when she observes that the process leads to “the replacement of complex realities with simplistic ones.”<sup>2</sup><br><br>Such tendencies toward homogenization, simplification, and erasure are a reminder of the importance of archives. Without them, the fabric of a city might be like a corporate webpage that seeks to hide all past versions of itself behind an illusion of timelessness. The very existence of archives is a reminder of historical time itself, making them lifelines out of an opaque and frozen present. But more than that, the contents of archives give granularity and a feeling of reality to that which risks becoming symbolic, then forgotten, then lost to history. <br><br>When I moved to the Mission District in 2008, gentrification (particularly of Valencia Street) had long been underway. I often wonder how different my experience of moving would have been had I not simultaneously come across Erica Lyle’s <i>On the Lower Frequencies: A Secret History of the City</i>, which focuses mostly on the Mission and mid-Market. This collection of writings from different sources—letters, interviews, and Lyle’s zine <i>The Turd-Filled Donut</i>—contains references to many names, places, and events that may be archived nowhere else, save for the memories of those who were there. Encountering these, I was able to build a picture of my neighborhood whose traces I could see if I looked closely enough. It was this book that gave my experience historical traction—a sense that my present was in conversation with some kind of past.<br><br>For her part, Lyle seems to have been on the lookout for a similar kind of traction. In <i>On the Lower Frequencies</i>, she conducts a kind of historical dig in an old theater at 949 Market Street, where she and her friends were squatting, putting on punk shows, and offering free food:<br><br><i>Deeper and deeper into the theater I went, through layers of debris and history. I rummaged methodically through desks in management offices, finding family photos, receipts, licenses. Great piles of unsold tickets and pictures of half-assed graffiti tags on the theater’s tired facade before it closed. I found a negative of a woman standing on the deck of a boat, left behind in a folded-up envelope with the questions for the US Citizenship Exam scrawled on it in English and Chinese.<br>…<br> I see the piles of unspooled film on the projectionist room floor and think of a march filing past the theater during the 1934 General Strike. Cop cars burning, cinematically, nearby after the Dan White verdict. Gulf War marches, Rodney King riots. Last century’s subconscious ideas surfacing from the dark under the street, ideas fought for and acted out on Market Street.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br><img src=\'/media/02865.jpg\'><br><br>Every year, the fabric of the city turns over, and so much is lost in the debris. Lyle’s act of digging through the scraps, her writing, the publishing of <i>On the Lower Frequencies</i>, the stocking of this volume at the local Dog Eared Books, and the reading of it by me and others—all of these acts help to stave off the imminent wash of forgetting and abstracting of the past.<br><br>Currently, 949 Market is a mostly empty mall having a hard time attracting retail tenants.<sup>4</sup> Not only the people that Lyle describes but the very structure they occupied is gone; I will never have a chance to see a show there, nor sample the free bagels. But Lyle’s writing lets me inhabit a ghostly space, one that emerges at the intersection of anecdotes and photographs. This is much the same feeling I have looking at the photos of Amelia’s. And although I know none of these women, I do recognize something in the ease and conviviality that runs through the images. I am put in mind of the gathering points for different communities in Oakland, where I now live: highly contingent spaces for queer folks, for artists, for poets, and for so many others living in the margins. In the archives of Amelia’s, the invitations for birthdays, weddings, and other meetings are a reminder of how much these spaces are substrates for cultural survival. <br><br>That present spaces are threatened with closure is directly related to the ways that past spaces are threatened with erasure and forgetting. In “Theses on the Philosophy of History,” Walter Benjamin writes that “[o]nly that historian will have the gift of fanning the spark of hope in the past who is firmly convinced that even the dead will not be safe from the enemy if he wins.”<sup>5</sup> In the 1980s, women did the work to keep Amelia’s open: they ran the business, organized events, tended bar, warned each other of police attacks, danced, and kept each other warm in the glow of familiarity. The space itself may be gone, but the archivist’s work remains: to keep Amelia’s open in collective memory, with the door ajar for weary travelers from the future.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02866.jpg\'><br><br><img src=\'/media/02867.jpg\'><br><br>*<br><br>Notes (\"I can’t say I wish you war\")<br><br>(1) Tamer El Said, <i>Akher ayam el madina (In the Last Days of the City)</i> (Zero Production, Zawya Distribution, 2016).<br>(2) Rebecca Solnit, <i>Infinite City: A San Francisco Atlas</i> (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 2010).<br><br>Notes (\"History as Sanctuary Space\")<br><br>(1) Sarah Schulman, <i>The Gentrification of the Mind: Witness to a Lost Imagination</i> (Berkeley: University of California, 2012), 30.<br>(2) Schulman, <i>Gentrification of the Mind</i>, 36.<br>(3) Erica [Erick] Lyle, <i>On the Lower Frequencies: A Secret History of the City</i> (New York: Soft Skull Press, 2008), 120–21.<br>(4) J.

We know that the human body is comprised of multiple cavities that carry our insides, completing our bodies through their absence, never visible from the exterior. Cavities are markers of decay, gapes in the smooth enamel of our teeth, that allude to underlying breakdown. Some of us will lose ’em all (a mouthful of cavities, as the song goes). The list of tangible cavities is long— the orifice of a tree, the gap between our walls, underground caverns. Then there are the less perceptible ones, like nebulas, or the electromagnetic energy between the surface of the Earth and the inner edge of the upper atmosphere, <i>55 kilometers up</i>, or what lies beneath our disintegrating glaciers. A cavity itself is a falsehood, a hole inside a whole.<br><br><font color=\"#696969\">“8 April, Tuesday: The museum staff leave, Fedayeen, or members of a militia, take over the grounds of the museum and start shooting at US troops–the external walls of the museum are pitted with the impact of bullets. The staff tried to return to the museum but were unable to because of fighting in the area. There was also a sniper shooting from a second floor room in the museum.”</font><sup>1</sup><br><br>How do we define a cavity of time? It is all the space in between that gives shape to our existence. There’s coffee and thin cigarettes and walking and walking and sleeping too early and waking too late, going to the studio and not staying at the studio, there’s stretching and eating and more walking and more coffee, there are  ashes of guilt and trips to the chiropractor, storytelling and forgetting names, reading and forgetting names, considering the productive potential of neglect while admiring a blue winged bird, more walking, and more coffee. There is a lot of discussion about bad art and how to make bad art good art, there are beelines from one park to another, sewn together by attentive steps along sandy edges, it’s dancing alone, staying inside, a claustrophobia only cured by foliage and fauna. It is boredom, getting empty, feeling empty, being empty, working less, having less, being with less. Finding what is visible to be made invisible, what is left, what is lost, what we have, what we will never have again, what we cannot find, what we do not know, what belongs to whom, when what is from when remains undefined. When it is and it isn’t. Nothing and everything, a hole inside a whole.<br><br><font color=\"#696969\">“9 April, Wednesday: The statue of Saddam is pulled down (watched by millions of television viewers worldwide), perhaps providing a perfect cover for a heist. Two ‘armored personnel carriers’ were seen in the museum grounds by the local population who all seem to agree on that fact. A number of people went into the museum and stayed there ‘for two hours,’ according to the general estimate. They came out carrying many boxes and then left (there is no confirmation for this story from other sources). They apparently went in through the small side door of the museum for which they had a key (this door was still open on 10 April). The back door was also open– someone had forgotten to lock it.”</font><br><br>Cavity living involves a degree of slipperiness, in which the parameters of time feel hazy. It is unclear whether we are in now or then, in the way that we are uncertain if these vitrines possess anything inside of their cabinets (or if they are cabinets at all). Walls and pillars are hollowed out, an escape hatch is blocked, plywood has the contour of a gate but is cut like a  rame. Artifice is the vernacular, as told by this painting that is in fact a green portal, a futuristic form that indicates we may be elsewhere rather than here. The architecture, in its exposure and impairment, renders vulnerability and injury as much as absence and disappearance. We are in a beautiful and bruised sentiment.<br><br><font color=\"#696969\">“10 April, Thursday: Looting by the mob begins. Some people apparently went in through a small door which was open at the back of the museum. Later, the mob opened the small door near the main entrance and broke down the main door from the inside. Muhsin, the guard, tried to convince the American tank crew positioned nearby to come and protect the museum–they came once and drove off the looters but refused to remain, saying that ‘they had no orders to do so.’ Muhsin tried to chase away the mob, was frightened, left the museum and set off home.”</font><br><br>ON INJURY<br><br>On occasion we fail to remember the origin of a chronic injury. Or we recall with exactitude the moment of injury, but its manifestations have morphed into new, unrecognizable forms that feel disconnected from its provenance. Elbow pain, first associated with stress, can transform into intermittent spasms from overexertion, eventually making itself known as a pinprick of pain each time the humidity drops. There is a phantom injury that connects said elbow to your knee, inexplicably. It is all too familiar, a tingle, a veil of soreness, a well-trodden ache that functions like clockwork. What is true for the elbow and the knee is true for the heart and the head.<br><br><font color=\"#696969\">“11 April, Friday: Local mobs continue to loot the museum. The glass doors leading to the administrative offices are broken down by the mob, who go through and start pillaging the office furniture. Tables and chairs, computers, and other office equipment are hauled away. The curator’s safe was professionally drilled and opened, the salaries of the staff for the next two months were taken, as was her personal money—she had left it in the safe for safe-keeping. The keys of the museum were also taken from her safe.<br><br>A sharpshooter who had set up in a room on the second floor,  res at the US troops below through a small window—a rocket-propelled grenade was found there, and many spent cartridges. It is a strange place for a sharp shooter, safe and secure, but the view through a very narrow slit, is limited. Colonel Bogdanos’s opinion was that he could have shot towards the other side of the street, just to create general mayhem.” </font><br><br>There are many injuries that never fully heal, lingering like ghosts. This we know, as our lives are composed of plenty of partings. Many of us grew up in the shadow of conflict, with the consequences of war and its aftermaths being foundational to our existences. We traversed countless kilometers (as many as it took) to other cities in different countries to seek reprieve from incessant violence. We learned new languages, we built homes, we worked, we waited, we listened while you exclaimed with incredulity, <i>I cannot believe the news today!</i> It is pain that crosses lands and knows not of time. Burdened in one century and unburdened in the next, only to be re- burdened in the one after. Our lives are part of a long-term, collective reconciliation with no promise of cure. To this day, many of us have yet to return to where we began.<br><br>And what is a refusal to return, if not an open wound?<br><br><font color=\"#696969\">“12 April, Saturday: Mobs hit the museum again, taking the remaining chairs and tables, and smashing every office door with axes. Showcases in the galleries are smashed. All the cameras of Donny George, Research Director of the museum—his personal collection—are taken from his steel safe. He used them for museum purposes and thought they would be safer there than in his house. Filing cabinets are smashed.</font><br><br>The storerooms are ransacked by the mob; a third was only entered but left undamaged. Many objects are taken from these storerooms but the tally will not be known until the museum staff complete checking every object against the inventory. That will take many months as there are more than 170,000 objects with Iraq Museum (IM) numbers, as well as an immense collection for study purposes.”<br><br>We imagine what an injury looks like to a museum, a place that holds our secrets and our histories, or, as they are lesser known, our fraudulent, erroneous, and partisan pasts, the expressions and byproducts of cultural and political dominance that we rarely confront as our legacy. Before we consider the injury to the museum we must first acknowledge the injuries it has inflicted. These are houses of laurels, built on narratives that justify and concretize occupation and imperialism. Conquest, destruction, and pillaging are ingrained in institutionalized dispossession, and many museums—built by robber barons and sustained by their children and their children’s children— are keepers of the spoils of military superiority. <i>A mouthful of cavities.</i><br><br><font color=\"#696969\">“13 April, Sunday: The museum personnel return to work. The Director-General of Antiquities Dr Jabber and Donny George find the keys to the safe in the grounds of the museum. The mob is still milling around but they manage to drive them off the grounds. The museum restorer again asks the US troops stationed nearby to protect the museum– to no avail.”</font><br><br>Even still, we must reconcile with the reality that these spaces also have the capacity to heal, their restorative potential dissuading us from complete divestment. And some of these places themselves have endured monumental pain. Sixteen years ago, during the Invasion of Iraq, looters ransacked the National Museum in Baghdad. Pleas to U.S. forces to secure the building were ignored, and over the course of 36 hours thieves walked away with 15,000 objects, many of which were artifacts thousands of years old. Ritual vessels and busts, amulets and ivories, and sculptures of headless kings tumbled down the marble steps, later found in trunks of cars, wrapped in garbage bags, and dug up from backyards, only returned under the promise of amnesty. It was a place of protection left exposed, cavernous and bare.<br><br><font color=\"#696969\">“16 April, Wednesday: American tanks finally take up position in museum grounds. A few days later, two men come into the museum and return the Statue of the Assyrian King, Shalmaneser the Third, in three pieces, one of the Ubaid Reliefs and a few other items.”</font><br><br>ON FULLNESS<br><br>While some mourned this devastating plunder of “mankind’s heritage” from the “cradle of civilization,” others interpreted this loss more facetiously. At a press conference the day after the event, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld asked, “My goodness, were there that many vases? [Laughter.] Is it possible that there were that many vases in the whole country?” His glib response underscored the belief that the Iraqis are a civilization devoid of nice things and undeserving of them at the same time, justifying the rape of their history as the price paid for their “liberation.”<br><br><font color=\"#696969\">“Local mobs looted the museum between 10 and 13 April—the guard Muhsin left on 10 April when the situation became too dangerous. During those three days, somewhere between 6,000 and 10,000 objects went missing from the museum. Among them are some of the most famous objects in the collection–including the Warka head and the Ba Sidqi statue. It was discovered afterwards that the whole collection of seals had been taken too—that meant another 4,800 objects were missing. A lot more had been broken in the general mayhem of the looting.”</font><br><br>How do we determine fullness? 50 vases? 180? 1200? 750 but half are over 6,000 years old and all are heavier than 500 pounds? By the 171,000 objects that lived inside, above and underground, even if 30% were potentially fakes and only 53% were confirmed real and 17% were undecided? Is it by the 8,000 that went missing or the 7,000 that were returned? How do we even begin to measure what is lost to the cultural ether, perhaps never to be recuperated? And how do we quantify the value of stolen objects, the trophies of injury, that are cared for in perpetuity for our pleasure?<br><br>Perhaps we can accept fullness as a type of embodiment or animism, in which the materials we see—minerals, plants, and wood—are all charged with their previous lives, waiting to be roused. Or as variations on immensity and accumulation, where the dust collects and a heap of grass, clipped from decommissioned military sites, grows and sinks under its own weight. Or as an imperfect and porous memory cast across the room, permitting us to be disloyal to the real. How quickly our pictorial understanding of a place falls apart when  at planes are given forms and what is round is morphed into façade. We release ourselves from the obligation of authenticity and the expectation of authority. The curtain begins to bend beyond the edges of our recollection. We untie the lion from power.<br><br><font color=\"#696969\">“A steady trickle of returning objects has been taking place since Colonel Matthew Bogdanos declared a general amnesty for anyone who brings back an object. Therefore, at the time of publication, more than 2,500 objects have been returned, largely by people who live in the immediate neighborhood. They come to the museum and say, ‘I went in with the mob, and I took this to save it and here it is.’ The Warka Vase was returned, cracked but virtually intact. It is possible that some of the other important objects may resurface someday.”</font><br><br>ON GHOSTS<br><br>The process of healing can be an uneasy affair, as we are burdened not only by what it means to be liberated from pain but by what it means to be free at all. As stated by Rumsfeld, “Freedom’s untidy, and free people are free to make mistakes and commit crimes and do bad things. They’re also free to live their lives and do wonderful things. And that’s what’s going to happen here.” There goes that tinny drip, like a persistent pang.<br><br>Pillagers, plunderers, conquerors, pirates, looters, robbers, aren’t we all? Under the guise of care we possess, we control, we manage, we dominate, we colonize—these are the foundations of freedom. It has always been a one-sided negotiation. We are all complicit in the dispossession of land, in validating the circulation of objects that do not belong to us and continue to not belong to us, in knowingly and unknowingly oppressing others. To be free of pain we must first uncover a breed of freedom that is not dependent on the subjugation of others.<br><br>Until then, we are haunted.<br><br>***<br><br>It is possible there is no recovery from injury, as to ruin a life is to live amongst ruins. It means to <i>be</i> ruined. Our only option is to weather the pain.<br><br>But in this stark inevitability we are still reminded of the words of Rumi: <i>the wound is the place where the Light enters you.</i><br><br>There just may be wholes inside of these holes yet.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02829.JPG\'><br><br><br>*<br><br><br>Abbas Akhavan’s practice ranges from site-specific ephemeral installations to drawing, video, sculpture and performance. The direction of his research has been deeply influenced by the specificity of the sites where he works: the architectures that house them, the economies that surround them, and the people that frequent them. The domestic sphere, as a forked space between hospitality and hostility, has been an ongoing area of research in his practice. More recent works have shifted focus, wandering onto spaces and species just outside the home – the garden, the backyard, and other domesticated landscapes.<br><br>Akhavan has had recent solo exhibitions at The Power Plant Contemporary Art Gallery, Toronto (2019), Vie D\'ange, Montréal (2018), and Museum Villa Stuck, Munich (2017). Group exhibitions include Liverpool Biennial, Liverpool (2018), SALT Galata, Istanbul (2017), Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York (2016), and Wellcome Collection, London (2016). Recently he was an artist-in-residence at Atelier Calder, Saché (2017), Fogo Island Arts, Fogo Island (2013, 2016, 2019), and Flora: ars+natura, Bogota (2015). Akhavan is the recipient of Kunstpreis Berlin (2012), The Abraaj Group Art Prize (2014), and the Sobey Art Award (2015).<br><br>*<br><br>Notes:<br>(1) All quotations are from a timetable of events excerpted from: Selma Al-Radi, “The Destruction of the Iraq National Museum,” <i>Museum International</i> vol. 55 (2003): 103-107.<br><br>Timetable of events excerpted from: Selma Al-Radi, “The Destruction of the Iraq National Museum,” <i>Museum International</i> vol. 55 (2003): 103-107.<br><br>*<br><br>Visit the exhibition <a href=\'/gallery/abbas-akhavan-cast-for-a-folly-2019\'>here</a>.<br><br>Download an PDF of the exhibition brochure <a href=\'https://wattis.org/media/02156.pdf\'>here</a>.<br>',''),(939,1,'2020-02-01 04:11:52','2020-03-21 01:21:21',4160,'On Vincent Fecteau\'s solo exhibition\r\nby Anthony Huberman',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'on-vincent-fecteau-s-solo-exhibition-by-anthony-huberman',NULL,'2019-09-05 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,'',_binary '<img src=\'/media/02335.jpg\'><br><br>1. These sculptures are tools.<br><br>Some artists begin with an idea or an opinion, and use it to make an artwork—first comes the meaning, then comes the object. But for <a href=\'/gallery/vincent-fecteau-2019\'>Vincent Fecteau</a>, ideas never work. His sculptures don’t come as a result of an idea but are the tools he uses in his attempt to generate ideas and make meaning.<br><br>He begins with an initial impulse or desire (the specific trigger quickly becomes irrelevant) and proceeds by folding, cutting, twisting, trimming, adding, leveling, scraping off, smoothing out, carving away, turning over, twisting back, and adding again. He ties knots into other knots. Bit by bit, he locates the sharpest edges of whatever emerges—the parts of an object that cut into meaning in a way that makes ideas nervous or that puts them on alert. Eventually, each sculpture is wound up until it can’t be made any tighter, sharpened until it can’t be made any sharper, and it is released into the wild, perhaps to become a tool for other people as well.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02336.jpg\'><br><br>2. These sculptures are abstract.<br><br>Everything is abstract. By which I mean—a thick sludge of matter, energies, and consciousness is all there really is, at the end of the day. And these sculptures are simply tools that try to access the abstract. They work at getting a bit closer to it, maybe even to stick their toes in it, to get dirty with it. Fecteau doesn’t invent an abstract form as much as he learns how to find one.<br><br>These sculptures don’t believe in distinguishing the abstract from the really real. Abstraction is not a chosen style or a composition but is deeply human—it’s about the lived experience of locating and co-existing with it. Any other artwork, be it a figurative painting or a realistic photograph, is just as abstract as Fecteau’s, only differently so.<br><br>That said, these sculptures aren’t anchored to the world by being connected to a recognizable topic, message, or, worse, an instruction for how to think or what to believe. Instead, they communicate by speaking a language art is particularly good at—that of arranged shapes, colors, textures, intuitions, and intentions. <i>I decided not to approach content directly, but to trust that it would follow me as I moved around the room. </i> (Fecteau).<br><br><img src=\'/media/02337.jpg\'><br><br>3. These sculptures are made by Vincent Fecteau.<br><br>Fecteau grew up on Long Island, went to Wesleyan, studied painting, interned with Hannah Wilke for a summer, didn’t like New York that much. He took time off from college and moved to San Francisco in 1990 to work with ACT UP. He worked as a studio assistant to Nayland Blake for a few years, handpainted ceramics, and ended up as a florist. He had his first show in 1994, consisting mostly of photo-collages of cats. When Blake decamped for the East Coast, Fecteau took over his apartment and has been making his handcrafted sculptures ever since. When I asked him what he was reading these past few months, he mentioned <i>Now the Night Begins</i>, a novel written by the French filmmaker Alain Guiraudie (<i>Stranger by the Lake</i>). He lives near Balboa Park in the Mission Terrace neighborhood. There is a great painting by Tomma Abts in his kitchen. He bikes everywhere.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02340.jpg\'><br><br>4. These sculptures are necessary.<br><br>Like practically any other work of art, these sculptures are made by someone who needs to make them. The question is not to ask <i>how</i> Fecteau makes them but <i>why</i> he makes them. The answer, always, is somewhat embarrassing or humiliating, since the sculptures end up saying more about the artist than anything else. They reveal too much, because all self-portraits reveal too much. In all they say about his achievements and capabilities, they say just as much about his limitations. They contain his secrets.<br><br>But these objects also embody the contradictions that all of us are: they appear calm yet agitated, exposed but also secretive, fully formed but still formless.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02343.jpg\'><br><br>5. These sculptures are traps. <br><br>Vince sends me a Youtube link. It’s a talk by the artist Don Potts, from 1981.<br><br><i>You go to that feeling, you work on the trap, the trap sucks the feeling in, makes the feeling a little bit more concrete, you go back to the trap, you get rid of the junk, you build a more pure version, you go back to the feeling, and you just go back and forth. And over the course of the whole process, you start sucking this thing in, sucking this thing in—the trap is starting to catch it. (…) And then, one part of this trap becomes very important. No fussing around in this area. Other areas, you know, there’s some glue hanging off it, or maybe an inch too big, it’s not important. (…) What you’re trying to catch is something you’ve never had your hands on. It’s subtler than you can think, than your awareness can comprehend. So the trap has to be subtler than any trap you’ve ever made. You can’t use old trap-making techniques. It will just get you so far, but it won’t take you that last step, to catch that thing. So you’re all alone, well not all alone, mom is always around, [laughter], but you can’t go to history books, you can’t go to past work, you have to just respond to what it is you’re trying to catch. And it gets incredibly exciting. (…) At the last moment, when you put the last touches on the trap, something will happen. It’s not a trap anymore, it is what you’ve been trying to catch. This thing becomes that awareness or that idea, or whatever—you can’t talk about these things with words, you know. And there it is. And you look at it. And there have been times when I’ve just, you know, cried. Not, you know, going- to-lie-down-on-the-bed crying, [laughter] but emotion will just pour out of my eyes. </i>(Don Potts)<br><br><img src=\'/media/02344.jpg\'><br><br>6. These sculptures are leaps of faith.<br><br>The painter Agnes Martin talked about <i>surrendering</i> the intellect. For many, to allow experience to precede cognition is a scary proposition. It puts us in a vulnerable place—walls need to be down, filters off. But what is art about if not vulnerability? Clicking back to Don Potts: <i>you need to be working right at that bottom edge of your nervous system. </i><br><br>Fecteau never draws and never makes preliminary sketches—he jumps right in. When he makes a cut into a shape, he can’t click undo but can only allow consequences to determine his next set of decisions. There is no safety net. It’s like when you delete that sentence you’ve become really attached to, even though you don’t yet know what will replace it. These sculptures don’t <i>know</i>, they <i>believe</i>. <br><br><i>These sculptures are made the way kids build backyard spaceships, with meticulous attention to detail, a grudging respect for the trash he works with, and no real hope of re-creating what he sees when he closes his eyes.</i> (Dennis Cooper)<br><br><img src=\'/media/02342.jpg\'><br><br>7. These sculptures are new.<br><br>Even if they resemble others that came before it. They were made all at once, as a group, over the period of a year and a half. Decisions have migrated from one to another, making them siblings, of sorts—related but self-sufficient. They are made of carved foam, painted papier-mâché, and bits of resin clay. Some 3-D scanning and a 5-axis CNC router were also involved at one point in the process, which, for the artist, has been an experiment.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02346.jpg\'><br><br>8. These sculptures are evidence.<br><br>These sculptures are the physical traces of a desire, an intention, or an impulse. They provide evidence of personal and material limitations. They capture the artist’s present state of mind, putting it on display for all to see. <br><br>They are also evidence of a battle between what is and what needs to be. They began on an open battlefield, where possibilities seemed endless. The material made a move, the artist made another, and art made yet another, each maneuvering itself away from, around, but also closer to the other. As they close in on each other, the decisions get smaller and smaller. The grip tightens. <br><br>To some of you, these sculptures will resonate, or strike a chord. They will prove that you share something with someone else. They are evidence that you are not alone.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02341.jpg\'><br><br>9. These sculptures are here. <br><br>They sit on white pedestals, on display in a gallery. They claim space, perhaps even <i>compress</i> space. They are not models or surrogates for something else. They aren’t <i>also</i> elsewhere, the way images can be. <i>They exist in the world irreducibly and uncontainably</i> (Fecteau). Their job is to make manifest, in physical form, some of what is <i>not</i> here, or at least not visibly so—the psyche, the libido, and everything else that remains unsaid and unsayable.<br><br>Also here are photographs by <a href=\'https://www.greenenaftaligallery.com/artists/lutz-bacher/\' target=\'new\'>Lutz Bacher</a>. She and Fecteau have been friends for many years, often sharing ideas and inspirations. Sometimes, Fecteau would come across an object or a situation and would immediately know—<i>that’s a Lutz</i>. He would have to pull over or stop to take a picture, and send it to her. She would usually respond with an emoji or two. Years later, much to his delight, he would find out that she had turned the image or object into an artwork. Before she passed away, just a few months ago, the two artists had the idea of including some of those in this exhibition—works by Bacher that had originally been images Fecteau had found and sent her. They come back to him now, charged with life and friendship.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02345.jpg\'><br><br>10. These sculptures are untouchable.<br><br>Which is ironic, because they were made by hand and consist of nothing other than the physical traces of the artist’s own touch. But these sculptures are untouchable in the way sound is untouchable—physically felt but impossible to actually hold on to. They look like what a polyrhythmic piece of music might look like, where many rhythms are made to intersect and overlap, even if they’re all happening at the same time, on top of each other.<br><br><i>I imagine an artwork as a fire that people gather around</i>, Fecteau once said. His sculptures are untouchable not because they might burn your hand but because the “art” in them is located in the energy they generate and in the emotions they mobilize. And, like the warmth of a fire or a melody, these sculptures can’t be photographed. Should you try, most of the object will be absent from the image—and that’s sculpture’s great advantage over other forms of art: it’s always hiding something. As Don Potts said about his traps, <i>if too much of the hook is exposed, the fish doesn’t bite.</i><br><br><br>P.S. These sculptures are not art.<br><br><i>Art is an ideal. It’s not an actual object. Objects can be evidence of an aspiration to “art,” but I think “art,” as a concept, is something bigger. It’s truth. It’s beyond museums and galleries and even artists. It’s out of our reach. How we use our limited means to try and approach this truth can be very moving.</i> (Fecteau)<br><br>*<br><br>The images above are different views and details of a single work: Vincent Fecteau, <i>Untitled</i>, 2006, papier-mâché, acrylic, 35 × 78 × 65 cm.

Six years after graduation from Simon Fraser University, and the end of his pestology career. He was born thirty years before, on the day right after his parents arrived by boat to Canada, which was forty-eight years after his grandfather left China to work as a labourer for the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. Before New York the second time, there would be art classes at New York University, which included witnessing an intense, provocative performance by Vito Acconci and a 19th-century art class with Robert Rosenblum. This was alongside the cockroach-infested apartment in Brooklyn and the many hours spent in the dying days of Max’s Kansas City. It would be four years after family illness and a scarcity of funds brought him home. One year after his second graduation. And two years after his mother died. <br><br>1986 would also bring his first solo exhibition in New York at Gallery Nature Morte, an artist-run space founded by Peter Nagy and Alan Belcher that operated for six years in the East Village in the 80s. At the time, his grandmother was living in Brooklyn, having come to New York from China in the early 1960s. She had lived in the Lower East Side with her family of six, in a cramped one-bedroom apartment in a run-down tenement building, before moving to an outer borough. Many of the circumstances that would cause him to leave were the reasons she would always have to stay. For her, the city was comprised only of her place of home and her place of work. He would visit her, on this second time, and tell her about his show.<br><br>Similar to his other relatives in the city, his grandmother worked in a sweatshop in Chinatown, sewing garments. He recounts going to the shop as a boy, remembering that the air was so thick with lint it made it impossible to breathe without a mask. The noisy, industrial-electric fans provided a modest reprieve from the intense heat and humidity. In cluttered quarters, young women worked with babies strapped to their backs, while toddlers stood patiently in wait for their mothers to complete their shifts. Jay Mazur, then the secretary-treasurer of the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union, proclaimed sweatshops were “the shame of the 1980s in this state, and in many parts of this country.”<br><br>On the night of his opening, he was startled by a surprise visit from his grandmother. Knowing not a word of English, she had navigated herself to the East Village from Chinatown by showing the invitation card to strangers, following their directions until she arrived at the gallery. Upon entering, she began calling out his name in Cantonese, generating a small crowd around her that was curious about her presence at the event. Was he hallucinating her voice? Stopping mid-conversation, he stood in a state of disbelief, as attendees parted so she could approach. She was dressed in what he described as poor Cantonese attire, invitation in hand. She peered at him and asked repeatedly in her native tongue, <i>What is all this? Who are all these people?</i><br><br>He stood speechless and mortified. His tenderness toward her only heightened his feeling of exposure. To know her was to know another him. <i>My family. My class. My race. My private self, as opposed to my public self. My non-artist self, as opposed to my artist self. They had been made painfully visible to me, and for all to see.</i> They stand next to each other, and she asks again. <i>Who are all these people?</i> <br><br><img src=\'/media/02923.jpg\'><br><br>2. <br>There are rules. There always have been. There are rules that determine the parameters of what is enough and what isn’t. There are rules that say who is allowed inside that are different from the rules that define who gets to stay. It is still, thirty-two years later, foolish to believe that admission, acceptance, and success in the art world are detached from race, class, and gender. It remains disappointing that this realization does nothing to mitigate the demoralizing effects of living with this knowledge, or the constant anxiety that comes with adhering to the endless social rules and economic expectations once inside. <br><br>Yet somehow, for many of us, it is better to be of this place, than on the outskirts of it. And choosing to be of this place is also choosing a life of fraudulence—a perpetual performance of class tourism and privilege that further divides art from the real, while distancing us from the more fraught and messy parts of ourselves. The parts that are cognizant of the fact that the middle class is stretchy and undefined only to those within it, or that the experiences that make us fraught and messy have no currency if we do not have the power to articulate them.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02919.jpg\'><br><br><img src=\'/media/02920.jpg\'><br><br><img src=\'/media/02921.jpg\'><br><br>But what happens when the real seeps through? When it weaves through the streets, and arrives at your front step, invitation in hand? That line between the fraudulent you and the non-fraudulent you becomes more tenuous when a fundamental piece of your identity forces itself in. And what if you don’t stop it? You let the personal hemorrhage into the public, like a cavalcade of uncertainty around domestic ideals and the limitations of ambition, the albatrosses of class affiliation and racial identity, and the insecurities of your childhood and the weight of parental expectations. There is no shortage of the real when presenting the many conflicting moments that compose both versions of yourself. What’s pushed out the door comes back through the window.<sup>1</sup><br><br>A space that inhabits both your shame and your relief is not one of reconciliation. It is, somehow, one that is equal parts affirmation and contradiction, real and imagined. It is how you can be alienated by labour while gathering self-worth from your competence. Or being embarrassed in private about being proud in public. Within this space, it is possible to be a person that offers empathy while being subsumed with incredulity, or to believe in a system that nurtures us, while losing faith in the very system that holds it together. You can be imbued with dignity but die anyway. Here, you can make a perfect home in which no one is permitted inside, or entice the wayward by declaring your family broken. You can be the lone child survivor of a police bombing—<i>a goddamn miracle</i>—only to be bested by a hot tub on a cruise ship. <br><br><img src=\'/media/02918.jpg\'><br><br><br>3. <br>Legibility of these things is determined by the real (the inside matters as much as the outside). As the story goes, he grew up in East Vancouver, a working-class neighbourhood largely populated by Chinese, Italian, Greek, and Japanese immigrant families, in a home on one of Vancouver’s oldest row-house blocks. The spectre of poverty hung over their household—his mother worked in a sweatshop and his father took on a number of menial jobs, while his grandparents toiled on farms outside of the city. He would even help his mother in the strawberry fields in the summer months, starting at the age of six. It was difficult enough to be a visible minority, but a poor one at that left little room for conceiving of a better lot.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02924.jpg\'><br><br>One of his childhood pastimes was to imagine ways to “improve” the family home, taking inspiration from the numerous home-furnishing flyers and catalogues that would be delivered outside their door. He envisioned himself in the showroom compositions, as if kindred with <i>those people</i>. His favourites were living rooms with matching loveseats that faced one another, flanking a fireplace. There were two fictions at work—the first that these depictions were real, and the second that these were homes his family could someday afford. <br><br>Many years later, one year after New York (the first time), he would compose an installation of rented furniture involving a set of bright orange lamps and a boldly patterned brown and orange sofa arrangement. To his surprise, people laughed at its tackiness. He had chosen things, in earnest, based on what he felt his mother would have loved. Many, many years later, long after he left New York (the second time), he would relay this story at an artist talk at a notable American institution. At the dinner afterward, a prominent white curator questioned his sincerity, implying he deceived the audience by liking something that would be universally understood as “ugly.” <br><br>The real infects us all, in different ways. <br><br>Consider this space as one in which the collision between art and the real is both abrupt and seamless. It is a space in which plausibility does not equate to resolution. Being convinced by what we see and what is being said does not solve the disjuncture between what we are being told and what we conjure. In the same way that we do not know any of these people, we recognize them. We can identify images of labour, loss, and value as racialized and gendered, while being simultaneously overwhelmed by a subject’s extreme ordinariness and banality. We can be struck by the sentimentality of a boy mentally transposing himself into home-furnishing flyers to imagine a better, unobtainable, life, while feeling discomfited by, and guilty of, exclusion. The agitation is intentional. <br><br><i>My grandmother did not know anything about the art world, nor even what contemporary art could be. And yet, there she was.</i> <br><br>A child sees a fantasy, and we see her meeting an ambivalent pig. <br><br><img src=\'/media/02925.jpg\'><br><br>*<br><br>Notes: <br>(1) Hat tip to Marina Roy for this perfect turn of phrase.<br><br>Ken Lum (b. 1956, Vancouver) lives and works in Philadelphia.

Instead we witness and experience these ecologies, these forms, these other worlds, as they amplify the force of a language, a movement, a landscape, a ruin, a life felt without this time, not a time that we know but a time that we get to know, that we get to feel, that we get to live in, if just for a second. Here rhythm, frame, color, sound, the cuts, the intervals, the monologues, the picture, the word, the silence saturates the instant with breath, keeps beat with the now and what’s to come. But these pieces don’t let us forget what came before us, what exists without us, and what will come after us. What these works show us is not an alternative to time. We’re not waiting. Something else is at work. <span style=\"color:#ff0000\"><i>Deep-Time Construction</i></span> grapples with what situates us in time, how we come to embody its cadence, and yet transforms this experience into one that is felt out of synch and at another register. Transformation is real, imaged, and envisioned. The intensity of this is located from within the experiential, the embodied, the felt, the poetic gesture, the aesthetic logic. The encounter is tender yet bold. Generative but subdued.  <br><br>We can’t speak of time without speaking of space, and this exhibition offers a platform where we are able to process, question, and think about the urgencies that time-based videos are able to showcase. And to speak of space materially, it is no accident that <span style=\"color:#ff0000\"><i>Deep-Time Construction</i></span> was commissioned and exhibited at the Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts, one of the few non-collecting contemporary art spaces in the United States. While we are not identical structures, we are in agreement that art spaces could enact the hope non-permanence might offer: we do not settle here. <span style=\"color:#ff0000\"><i>Deep-Time Construction</i></span> and its space don’t allow for this type of relation with land, with space, with frame. The works in <span style=\"color:#ff0000\"><i>Deep-Time Construction</i></span > were imagined to enter, exist, and exit the structures of the Wattis; the Wattis constructed against the strictures of the encyclopedic mausoleum becomes the space in which we were able to grapple with better questions: How does deep-time reconstitute the possibility of noncolonial space? How does the image return us to a place we want to know, we dream of loving, we think of as home? <br><br>In <i>A Map to the Door of No Return: Notes to Belonging</i>, pivotal poet and writer Dionne Brand most profoundly queries the politics of settlement and belonging. Citing Eduardo Galeano who wrote, “I’m nostalgic for a country which doesn’t yet exist on a map.” Brand responds, “Dear Eduardo, I am not nostalgic. Belonging does not interest me. One is misled when one looks at the sails and majesty of tall ships instead of their cargo. But if it were a country where you were my compatriot, then I would reconsider. And think of the things we should have to sort out.” <br><br>Brand’s text has been an anchor for our writing, thinking, editing, process. Her searing and loving critique of venerable late journalist Eduardo Galeano became a model for how we might think about the curatorial process, the “think of the things we should have to sort out” with the people we care for yet have disagreements with. Her articulation against nostalgia, against the waiting for the place to come, is a guiding political horizon. In the sourced simulacra from which we began and continue, we capitulate only belonging and venture all else.<br><br>*<br><br>Visit the exhibition <a href=\"/gallery/contemptorary-deep-time-construction-2018\">here</a>, including a series of commissioned essays by Nazik Dakkach, Sean D.

This is not to say that there haven’t been many terrible times in our many lifespans. In fact, a continuous stream of terrible has brought us to this moment. As we know, the West is borne out of trauma—from the violent expropriation of land, to the blatant theft of bodies and resources and relentless exploitation of labour, to the countless wars that have been initiated in service of settler colonialism. The air we breathe and the soil we stand on is not exempt from this barbarism, suffering long deaths in the aftermath of military conflict and climate change. Who can keep up with this litany of terrible? There is too much rot in all of these bones.<br><br>THE WEATHER –– Lest we forget, the environment elucidates imperialism not only through space, bodies, labour, and resources, but also time (do not be misled by its perceived invisibility or its slowness). Although the materiality of <i>time</i> is felt all over this earth—via oil spills, toxic drift, massive deforestation, melting polar ice caps, and the sinking sea floor—ecological degradation is frequently placed outside of conventional definitions of violence. We are talking about the disasters that are heavy with languor but insidious at their core. The terrible times that unfold over decades, if not <i>centuries</i>.<br><br>TO KEEP IN MIND –– In physics, radiation is considered to be the emission of subatomic particles or electromagnetic waves, undetectable to the naked eye.<br><br>THE WEATHER (CONT\'D) –– We must imagine the other side of the catastrophe. The side in which we can finally see that we did not fall <i>into</i> this time, we fell <i>through</i> it. A descent that is not immediate, explosive, or visible, but rather unremarkable and gradual. It is what Rob Nixon refers to as <i>slow violence</i>—an incremental, attritional violence with devastating repercussions that develop out of sight and across a multiplicity of temporal scales and spaces.<sup>1</sup> Achieved through accumulation, slow violence resides in the lengthy, fatigued space after a calamity. The long-term emergency that is ignored in favour of the more visceral spectacles of burning towers, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, and fallen bodies.<br><br>A LOSING BATTLE (DON\'T WORRY IT\'S GONNA BE TERRIBLE FOREVER) –– Similar to their human, animal, and plant counterparts, radioactive isotopes each have their own pattern and rate of decay. The time it takes for half of the atoms of radioactive material to disintegrate is referred to as its half-life (t1⁄2). Rates of decay range from microseconds to billions of years. Billions! It extends to a time not carried in a single person, outside of human memory, one that exceeds our comprehension. These are toxins that poison a future we cannot conceive, in bodies that do not yet exist.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02912.jpg\'><br><br>FOR REFERENCE, LATER –– <br><br>Pitchblende, a type of uraninite, has a radiation level that is four times that of uranium.<br><br>WHICH BRINGS US HERE –– How do we articulate unspectacular time?<br><br>Photography, historically, has been understood as a medium that captures and exhibits truth (and we cannot dismiss that its failures in this regard have diminished its activist power). But for Susanne Kriemann, photography is a medium that expands into time and the eye, an inner camera obscura. It is an entity that has always existed to see itself through its chemical and optical properties. For her, the world is an analogue “recording system” for human-caused processes, in which change and obsolescence are slowly registered onto our physical environment. The work demands a form of process that feels unfamiliar today—one in which we are asked to return to a prolonged mode of seeing, to investigate the details <i>between the processes</i>, the invisible markers of slow change. <br><br><img src=\'/media/02913.jpg\'><br><br>THE LONG EXPOSURE –– The most radioactive place in the United States is Hanford, Washington, which housed a decommissioned nuclear production complex that manufactured plutonium for atom bombs during World War II. The materials produced at this facility were subsequently used to create the first nuclear bomb, as well as Fat Man, the bomb dropped over Nagasaki, Japan, in 1945. Approximately two-thirds of this nation’s highly radioactive waste (solid and liquid) resides on this site. <br><br>See: <i>Plutonium, 80.8 million years</i>. <br><br>ANOTHER –– Between 1946 and 1990, the German Democratic Republic converted the Erzgebirge Mountains in the eastern part of Germany into one of the world’s largest uranium mining sites, ultimately becoming the most significant supplier of uranium to the Soviet nuclear armament program. Highly radioactive and uranium-rich, pitchblende was relentlessly mined for decades, resulting in a landscape so rich in toxic metals that it will be polluted for over 100,000 years. Despite the toxicity of the mines and the documented health threats to the miners who worked there, plans are currently underway to transform the Erz Mountains into a tranquil mountain vista, with few recognizable traces of the still-radiating industrial worksites.<br><br>See: <i>Uranium, billions! of years.</i><br><br>TRACES –– The imperceptibility of radioactivity is emphasized in the series of héliogravures, which depict three plants from the former mining territories of Gessenwiese and Kanigsberg in the Erz Mountains. Among the flora growing in this region, Falsche Kamille, Wilde Möhre, and Bitterkraut (False Chamomile, Wild Carrot, Ox Tongue) were found to be amongst the most capable of extracting and storing their environmental pollutants.<sup>2</sup>Toxicity is woven into the production of the work itself: The pigments from these unique héliogravures derive from organic material harvested from the three weeds. Extremely fragile, the pigments eventually lose their colour once exposed to light, leaving only micro-traces of the noxious metals that have become part of the plants’ cellular compositions.<br><br> ALL IS NOT LOST –– Nestled within a collection of archival boxes are soft bundles of wool from sheep that graze radiated land, casts of fish from contaminated water, and other detritus (née evidence) from legacies of chemical and radiological violence. The tiles generate a visual index of the untold narratives of radioactivity worldwide, reminding us that in the cycle of slow violence, an immeasurable number of long and forgotten deaths precede growth and renewal.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02914.jpg\'><br><br>TO KEEP IN MIND AGAIN–– In biology, radiation refers to divergence from a central point, specifically the evolution from an ancestral animal or plant into a variety of new forms.<br><br>Before we give in to this moment of devastation we should return to the story of the humble weeds in Germany. Through a natural photosynthesis process, the plants both grow and become more toxic simultaneously as chemicals accumulate within them. But in an act of quiet rebellion, they are also (<i>on their own volition!</i> ) cleansing the soil. Alongside fungi, bacteria, and insects, these organisms are purifying the soil of depleted landscapes by amassing rare earths and minerals, beginning a protracted but tender process of regeneration.<br><br>THE AWNING (OR, EVEN IF WE GIVE UP, THEY WILL REFUSE)–– We begin to conceive of a timeline outside of ourselves, a secret parallel universe that is working little by little to transform the tragedy we had wrought across these lands. Weaving through the beams of the space are bolts of raw silk dyed with soils and organic inks harvested from the polluted lands of the former uranium mining territories. Depicted in the fabric are the abstracted gills of wild mushrooms. There is much to learn from the wild mushroom and its resilient strategies for survival. Unable to grow in captivity, it thrives in precarious, fractured ecosystems and establishes symbiotic camaraderies with plants, trees, microbes, and humans to endure. It salvages what has been lost.<br><br>Through the mushroom we see that underneath this gauzy, uneven stretch of time lies both promise and ruin. And it is here, from the wreckages of violence, imperialism, and ecological disaster, that we can (<i>we must</i>) carve out alternate forms of existence, including ones that are quiet, vulnerable, and unspectacular. Even <i>slow</i><br><br><img src=\'/media/02915.jpg\'><br><br>AFTER ALL –– A terrible life is still a life.<br><br>*<br><br>Notes:<br> <br>(1) Rob Nixon, <i>Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the Poor</i>, (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2013). Based on Nixon’s research, Susanne<br>Kriemann conceptualized the seminar “Slow Violence” in 2017, in which she and her students at HfG Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design investigated long-time exposures through environmental pollution from a photographical point of view.<br>(2) Kriemann undertook field research with specialist geologists and biologists from the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena, who are studying the accretion of heavy metals in plants during the re-naturalization processes in this area. Kriemann identified that the three weeds contained substantial traces of lanthanum, gadolinium, germanium, uranium, mercury, lead, nickel, zinc, aluminium, and copper, among many other metals. In an alarming coincidence, these same metals are also essential raw materials in the manufacture of smartphones. <br><br>Susanne Kriemann (b. 1972, Erlangen, Germany) lives and works in Berlin and Karlsruhe. After completing her studies at the State Academy of Fine Arts in Stuttgart in 1997 (where she studied under Joan Jonas and Joseph Kosuth), Kriemann enrolled in the Programme de recherche at the École nationale supérieure des beaux-arts in Paris in 2000. She has exhibited her work internationally in Basel, Toronto, Shanghai, Vienna, Vancouver, Paris, and Rotterdam, and since 1998 has produced sixteen artist books as multiples. She has participated in numerous artist residency programs, including in Moscow, Stockholm, Cairo, and Vienna. Together with Aleksander Komarov, she is one of the co-founders of the artist-run initiative AIR Berlin Alexanderplatz.

If one were to try and reduce human subjectivity down to two words, that’s a start. On one hand, there is the body and its physicality, its biology, its impulses, its emotional states, its primal animality, and its automatic decisions. On the other, there is the mind and its ideas, its rationality, its opinions, its biases, its psychology, its methods, and its cunning calculations.<br><br>But not quite. It’s not instinct <i>and</i> intelligence, because the two can’t really be kept separate. It’s certainly not instinct <i>versus</i> intelligence, because one doesn’t necessarily antagonize or compensate for the other, even though they are often evoked in those terms. Perhaps it’s instinct <i>dancing with</i> intelligence, because both are distinct but entangled languages that are always in motion, always negotiating. <br><br>But that’s not quite it either, because the body and its expressive force is also a <i>form</i> of intelligence, not the yin to its yang. Like the mind, the body learns a language, accumulates and stores memories, and develops a maturity and an expertise. <br><br>Etymologically speaking, choreography means “to write with dance,” and Adam Linder has many ways to write with dance. In London, he trained with the Royal Ballet, worked with the Michael Clark Company, and spent time in latenight house music clubs. While his work is performed in the context of the stage and the theater, it has also found its way into art biennials all over the world, as more and more of them incorporate performance and dance. <br><br>Linder has looked at people like Serge Diaghilev, the founder of the Ballets Russes, but has also absorbed the histories and legacies of postmodern dance as well as those of conceptual art: its rejection of style, affect, and, God forbid, ornament. The Judson Dance Theater group demanded that style, technique, and spectacle be replaced by pedestrian and everyday movement, and Yvonne Rainer’s “No Manifesto” (1965) called for a rejection of virtuosic and expressive choreography in favor of a “de-skilling” that, the argument went, was more authentic, democratic, and anti-elitist. <i>No to eccentricity</i>, she wrote. <br><br>* <br><br>Despite all of that, dance is often brought into the white cube of the art museum as a way to spice things up. Even when “conceptual” in nature and form, performance is seen as an effective way to enliven an exhibition, to generate some buzz, to get some social media traction. In the art context, dance hasn’t been de-spectacularized, but has been asked to deliver something extraordinary, something you don’t see every day, something that will get its own special hashtag.<br><br>The art historian Claire Bishop calls this the “industrialization of performance”: It is goal-oriented, user-friendly, outsourced, and placed on heavy rotation. Performers work in shifts, meeting an endless demand for “being dynamic,” keeping up with a 168-hour cyberworkweek. As unsalaried art workers with nothing but the labor of their own bodies to sell, performers feel the pressure to say yes to every invitation.<br><br>Adam Linder demands that we value dance differently. <br><br><img src=\'/media/02854.jpeg\'><br><br>*<br><br>As a choreographer, Linder considers the dancer to be his most valuable material. More specifically, what he’s after is the dancer’s corporeal intelligence—that instinctual-slash-intelligent virtuosity that precedes language and exceeds concept. <br><br>He calls it <i>the juice</i>. It comes from a body’s accumulated life experiences in all of their impossible-to-measure forms. The juice is what’s left in the aftermath of money, language, or concept working to condition and contain everything. It’s what exceeds, what holds everything together, what Fred Moten calls the “invaluable.” There’s always more of it.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02855.jpeg\'><br><br>Nothing can ever entirely capture the character of a gesture, the rhythm of a step, or the temperament of a glance. Language can try, but words either fall short with too little or strangle with too much. Money can try, but once it does, those things lose their inherent value— in the way paying for love or justice does. People might try paying for talent, but its intensity is ultimately non-exchangeable.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02856.jpeg\'><br><br>* <br><br>And yet money and language both play a central role in Linder’s work. He is careful to not underestimate their importance in how value is created, but is equally careful to position them as nothing more than tools made available to what is ultimately far more valuable— the human subject and its many capacities or intelligences. <br><br>Linder provides dance as a <i>service</i>, making it possible for people or organizations to witness the many talents of a human body by hiring specific dancers to perform specific activities for a specific amount of time. It’s not about “the body,” as an abstraction, but about <i>these bodies</i>: They are of specific body types, genders, and skin colors; they come equipped with a specific accumulation of corporeal memories and experiences; and they move together, borrow from each other, and write with dance in ways no other bodies do.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02857.jpeg\'><br><br>Linder offers his services to clients via a contract. With its cold language and its focus on hard cash, a contract lacks ornament, sex, and flair. It’s the perfect contrast to dance.<br><br>In exchange for providing a service, Linder asks for money, sure, but only to support the artistic (and physical) labor that goes into it, not because he’s selling anything. He doesn’t consider dance as something to be possessed in the way an object can be bought and sold. To maintain their value, his services must remain his own property, because what’s being exchanged for money is not an object but a virtuosity, a body’s learned instinct and intelligence.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02858.jpeg\'><br><br>*<br><br>Linder doesn’t consider his work to be a critique. It often gets cited as an example of “institutional critique,” but his concern is not the institution and breaking down the power structures that enforce and are enforced by it. No, his project is the virtuosic skills, the corporeal intelligences, of a human body. The juice. <br><br>(… although institutions do sometimes get caught by stray bullets.)<br><br>Say a museum feels it’s a bit boring or sleepy. One solution might be to hire Linder’s Choreographic Services, just as it might hire the services of a graphic designer or a plumber to help solve another kind of problem. Perhaps having dancing bodies in the galleries will help attract a larger audience! And in many museums and cultural institutions, the activity that is often most highly valued is the one that draws the largest audience. People come to see a performance or an exhibition, and they become the customers that performers (and museums) hope to please. The more customers, the better.<br><br>So has the museum become a place for <i>customers</i> instead of <i>audiences</i>? Has an artwork been reduced to an exchange between an artist and a customer? Linder’s approach extracts his work from that dynamic by turning away from customer and toward client. <br><br>By providing a service, under contract with a client, he not only avoids the precarity imposed by the fluctuating likes and dislikes of any customer, but he also removes the emphasis from how public or popular his performance might be. Instead, the focus is redirected to how skillfully the bodies might be fulfilling the activities promised in the contract. <br><br>His audience is there to witness, not to consume.<br><br>In that sense, a Choreographic Service isn’t for an audience but for a single client. That client might choose to invite hundreds of people to see it, but the performance itself—along with the group of dancers performing it—isn’t working for them and isn’t subject to the whims of their preferences. If you were to hire <i>Some Cleaning</i> (2013), for example, a single performer would choreographically clean, renew, or recalibrate a space of your choice—like a mime working as a maid. And just as a maid is often dismissed, the performer can handle being dismissed. So if you choose to read a book or host a dinner party, feel free. Either way, dance is being written.<br><br>Or you could hire <i>Some Proximity</i> (2014), where two dancers work with an art critic to serve you some vernacular criticism. The art critic visits nearby exhibitions, makes critical observations and notes on what he or she sees, and relays those notes to the dancers, who then choreographically interpret them with their voices and movements. The notes accumulate on the gallery walls over the duration of the service, providing a loose score to which the dancers can refer back at any time. The critic uses a language that sounds more like gossip or anecdote than academic analysis, which helps it feel closer to the body.<br><br>If <i>Some Cleaning</i> uses the mime, <i>Some Proximity</i> uses the glide: A move that grew out of break dance, Russian folk dance, or even the infamous Moonwalk, the glide is a walk that is a couple of degrees higher in affect than walking. It’s a hyperbolic walk. A greasy walk. A juicy walk.<br><br>Once again, an audience is welcome, but not necessary—the bodies will be working (and gliding) no matter what. <br><br>*<br><br><i>Some Riding</i> (2015) doesn’t reflect its context but reflects itself: Two dancers recite two essays about embodiment and performance that Linder commissioned from the writers Catherine Damman and Sarah Lehrer-Graiwer—placing the piece’s theoretical underpinnings inside the work itself, not on the wall label or in the catalogue. The bodies perform with adagio, or a slow and gradual movement, but insert a popping to it, a robot-like bounce, giving the cadence of their reading a dancerly punctuation.<br><br>In <i>Some Strands of Support</i>(2016), two dancers work to tease, tame, coerce, or poke at an upright object or statue of the client’s choice (I chose an abstract steel sculpture by the local artist Charlie Leese). The bodies of the dancers move in oscillations, like a siren or a temptress. They are providing the service of “haircare” to the object, caring for or carefully grooming it. But it’s also full of ritual, fantasy, and desire, and it’s entirely plausible that the object is in fact there to service the dancers—to arouse and get them off.<br><br><i>Who is servicing whom</i>? is a question that hovers above all of Linder’s work— and it’s not just a question about sex or money, but a political one about our ability (or lack thereof) to determine who and how we serve.<br><br>Finally, <i>Dare to Keep Kids Off Naturalism</i> (2017) is where Linder’s rebuttal to the “anti-aesthetics” of Judson Church is most evident and sharptoothed. “Let’s do ornament <i>seriously</i>” he says. Four dancers, sometimes in elaborate costumes, work together to create different scenarios. They move through a range of registers and styles with skill and finesse, but without allowing any clear narrative to emerge. The service’s contract promises eight explicitly “anti-natural” situations: hustling, lubrication, animatronics, carpeteering, among others, and the dancers flirt with the walls, wear robotic prosthetics, and crawl beneath (what look like) Persian rugs, as if under some kind of spell. A musical score seems to provide a set of cues, but perhaps it’s not.<br><br>This service is where Linder most forcefully argues that theatricality does <i>not</i> amount to entertainment and that “de-skilled” does <i>not</i> necessarily mean “more authentic.” I dare you, he says, to value talent, virtuosity, and expertise—even in the face of a culture (at large) that often considers it elitist or undemocratic to do so. We live in a country, remember, where voters are convinced by candidates because they seem relatable, not because they seem to have command of the issues. <br><br>* <br><br>The Wattis Institute has hired all five of Linder’s Choreographic Services. Each one is presented over the course of three weeks, across two galleries. All are shared with the general public, except for a sixth “footnote” service, <i>Some Trade</i> (2018), which has been hired by a local collector and takes place in a private home in Pacific Heights. At the Wattis, each service is performed successively, but they also overlap and reappear in different combinations, creating new hybrids and juxtapositions of bodies and movements. <br><br>The sociologist Steffen Mau has pointed to two central modes of generating attention in today’s “evaluation society”: one is popularity or publicity, and the other is expertise. The two often find themselves in conflict, and when an emphasis is placed on one, the other tends to fall into the background. <br><br>It is of extraordinary importance to talk about how to increase and democratize access. And yet some go so far as to argue that a focus on craft is decadent, that exceptional skill is only exciting for a specialized audience—and how can we talk about aesthetics, anyway, when so many are suffering from injustice, starvation, and war? It’s a valid and even urgent point, of course, but it also sets up a false choice. In times of crisis and despotism, it seems crucial to value art and expression, and to encourage the pursuit of eccentricity and virtuosity in all of its many forms.<br><br>In Adam Linder’s work, dance and dancers (and art and artists) emerge legitimized and empowered, not marginalized. Contained within these performances is a set of embodied instincts and intelligences that, even if (and partly because) they can’t be measured and can’t be bought, are valuable to us all. “For me,” he says, “a performance is the performers.” Let’s witness and learn from them. <br><br>Adam Linder (b. 1983, Sydney, Australia) lives and works in Los Angeles.

The composition features 53 different short musical phrases, each of which is in the chord of C, and so even when performers play them out of sync, they are all in tune. Each fragment is made of tiny notes that move over, under, and within each other. It’s a <i>vast</i> kind of minimalism—a contradiction.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02843.jpg\'><br><br>Léonie Guyer makes paintings and drawings. They consist mostly of abstract shapes, usually modest in scale, made with oil paint or pencil. In her mind, an artwork is a place where countless decisions are condensed and compacted together, and she works to intensify that concentration by keeping her paintings small and reduced down to their bare essentials: color, surface, and shape. She tries to do the most with the least. <br><br>And yet to call her works “small” is misleading. Better would be to say that she makes “immeasurable” works of art, which doesn’t mean that they are epic in scale but simply that they are not meant to be measured.<br><br>Guyer is drawn to the moment that precedes language, and her work locates a space that we can’t yet recognize or describe. She is after something that is at the edge of visibility: pre-language, pre-shape, pre-geometry, perhaps even pre-existing. <br><br>But while Guyer seeks out the <i>pre-</i>, she doesn’t consider abstraction to be something that happens <i>before</i> representation, but that it is always already there. Just as Buddhist thought describes reality as a boundless flow that exists beyond visual appearance but that is attainable as a felt experience, Guyer’s abstract shapes are concentrated manifestations of 100,000 years of painting unfolding right now, in the present moment.<br><br>Put another way, in the words of the master Japanese potter Shoji Hamada, “good pots are born, not made.” <i>In The Life of Forms</i> (1934), the art historian Henri Focillon, a favorite reference of Guyer’s, argues that forms are not born of a cognitive act but are discovered, always already there—over, under, and within each other.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02844.jpg\'><br><br>Guyer has developed a repertoire of invented shapes—she calls them “reincarnations”—that are altered, bent, and endlessly readjusted. But first things first: before getting to the shape, she chooses a surface and begins mixing pigment and oil to make her paint.<br><br>For a painter, a surface is not just an object but is an architecture, and each surface presents a distinct set of problems, and prompts a distinct set of decisions about how to inhabit it. Guyer moves her consistent vocabulary of forms across a varied landscape of surfaces: there is the rectangular wooden board, a common support for a painting, on which she slowly builds up a foundation before articulating the edge of a shape. There is the marble fragment—with its broken rough edge and its clean manufactured ones—which creates an association to ancient archeological sites on the one hand, and to readymade interior decoration on the other, and establishes a proximity and a simultaneity between a contemporary experience and one that is thousands of years old. Guyer also uses thin pieces of aged paper she buys from a few suppliers who carry sheets that can sometimes be several hundred years old. The paper’s fragility, combined with the fact that it has survived for so long, gives the drawing an almost impossible or miraculous resilience, as if its tiny shape could withstand (and/ or contain) the most severe outbursts of emotions. Finally, there is the surface of the wall itself: Guyer paints small shapes in different areas within a room or a building. In this case, the paintings hover between discreet marks or traces and miniature frescoes that could potentially remain in place, hiding in plain sight, for decades or centuries. <br><br>Guyer then starts making the countless small decisions involved in knowing just how to inhabit these surfaces with painted or drawn shapes. At the same time, she is equally invested in the surfaces that are to remain unpainted— the expanses of negative space on the paper, board, marble, or wall that are left blank but are still very much an active part of the architecture of her work.<br><br>They, too, are in C.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02845.jpg\'><br><br>Then comes the shape. A simple dot or a line will not do. “It wouldn’t be idiosyncratic enough,” she says. <br><br>She applies multiple thin layers of paint, many of which are wiped away, until they coalesce into a unified whole. The forms are nuanced and precise but also amorphous and even a bit awkward. They could be formal abstract compositions, but also a hieroglyphic form of language, an ancient or secret symbol, or a mark on a graphic score. In that sense, they are the opposite of ornament: they aim to make painting feel stranger, not more comfortable. We could call them beautiful, but only because they are imperfect. <br><br>In this exhibition, these shapes are placed side by side, on shelves and on the wall. Daylight moves across them, like another kind of paintbrush, adding depth and tone. Despite all of the emptiness that separates them, they form a single wavering dance, or maybe a sentence, or, reading between the lines, even some abstract form of prayer.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02846.jpg\'><br><br>In describing what she meant by “deep listening,” the late minimalist (there’s that misleading word again) composer Pauline Oliveros noted the difference between hearing and listening: while the former is physiological, the latter involves an active subjectivity. Not only is it different for each of us, but it is a way to learn about that which we don’t already know. Listening, if given the proper attention and if embraced with the proper vulnerability, is a way the unfamiliar can become part of us. <i>Looking</i> and <i>seeing</i> have a similar relationship, and Guyer has placed a range of barely visible marks and lines on the walls for those who choose to see them. <br><br>Guyer is not a musician, but describing her work with a musical vocabulary is effective because her paintings are made with so much more than paint. To define her shapes, she takes the contours of Cycladic figures (6500 - 1650 BCE) or the lines in Near and Middle Eastern prayer rugs (13th - 15th centuries) and cooks them down over time. She collects Indian tantric paintings and Roman unguentaria, visits museums to see ancient Japanese and Korean vessels, and relates them to the abstractions of Constantin Brancusi or James Lee Byars, despite the cultures and centuries that separate them. She borrows equally from the fragile yarn sculptures by Fred Sandback or Richard Tuttle’s wire works as she does from Shaker tools and furniture pieces. <br><br><img src=\'/media/02847.jpg\'><br><br>If painting lies at the center of this work, different paths lead up to it and emerge from it. By choosing to show some of these other elements alongside her own work, Guyer has brought this subtle maze of references into the exhibition itself. <br><br>Lodged somewhere inside her abstract and condensed language of wordless shapes are Susan Howe’s poems made of shredded layers of word fragments. Guyer’s lines live within the tender craftsmanship and engineering of an oval box made by Shakers in the 19th century, while Shaker “gift drawings,” originally made as a way to share a message from God, could stand in for the ways the spiritual and the secretive—the <i>speaking-in-tongues</i>—runs through all of Guyer’s work. And the basic and essential forces of gravity and motion that Terry Fox captures in his video <i>Children’s Tapes</i> (1974), alongside the attentiveness necessary to experience them, are in play throughout the entire exhibition. <br><br>But let me get out of the way. Here is what the artist has to say about the objects she selected:<br><br><img src=\'/media/02848.jpg\'><br><br><i>Shaker gift drawings are very rare, made mostly by girls and women during a brief period in the 19th century. They are transcriptions of messages received in dreams from Mother Ann, dead saints, and friendly spirits. Delicate lines inscribe secret teachings that cannot be spoken but may be shared.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02849.jpg\'><br><br>This small oval box holds essential Shaker values—quality of attention, integrity, simplicity, harmony. In the Shaker world, action is prayer, work an offering.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02850.jpg\'><br><br>These minute glass vessels are about 2,000 years old. They may once have held oils, medicine, perfume, cosmetics, love potions, tears. Their awkward elegance and viridescence captivate.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02851.png\'><br><br>The “Children’s Tapes,” a series of actions performed for the artist’s young son in which humble elemental objects are used to enact various transformations. Or in a word, magic.</i> <br><br>Our time on earth is fragile, temporary, and brief. Many work to fit as much into it as possible, sometimes with remarkable and even miraculous results, and other times with terrifying and catastrophic ones. But in a moment when attention and visibility is determined not by what you say but by how loudly you say it, it might also be possible to simply listen. <br><br><img src=\'/media/02852.jpg\'><br><br>*<br><br>Léonie Guyer (b. 1955, New York, NY) lives and works in San Francisco.

Most of the time, we regulate and contain it. We cover it up with floors, roads, buildings, even entire cities. When it spills, we sweep it up—it’s as if we were hiding or repressing it. <br><br>But still, dirt is everywhere. It indicates that raw state lurking under every polished surface and every efficient system. In a sense, it represents all that is ungoverned.<br><br>And yet dirt is all over government, too. It’s all over people like <i>grab-them-by-the-pussy</i> Donald Trump, like ex-IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn, like exItalian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, or even like the impeached Bill Clinton. Hell, it’s all over the Catholic Church. And while there is nothing inherently dirty about any of these people, certain aspects of their conduct stand in stark contrast to their claims on power, legitimacy, and authority. They are only dirty insofar as they fray from a normative standard of behavior expected of those who make such claims.<br><br>Henrik Olesen adds dirt to the neatness of conceptual art. He is drawn to surfaces that are scarred, deformed, and uneven. His exhibitions often include or highlight unfinished walls, blocked doorways, or empty rooms—as if a backstage was demanding its rightful place within the public realm. His paintings, sculptures, and collages are deliberately rough.<br><br>At the same time, Olesen adds dirt to the sexlessness of conceptual art. He works against all that is antiseptic and toward an art that recognizes desire, profanity, obscenity, perversion, and <i>jouissance</i> as productive and emancipatory forces. He wants the thin cracks in a concrete floor to suddenly feel erotic. His work calls for a messiness of exceeded extremes—or, in the words of one of his favorite writers, San Francisco’s own Dodie Bellamy, “where pathology meets pleasure.” Jean Genet and George Bataille would surely concur. <br><br>Homosexuality, for example, threatened the codes of early modernity. Gay sex does not enable growth and does not yield a return—<i>like counterfeit money</i>, as one critic put it. One option is to fight for its own legitimacy, but another is to simply reject the very opposition it presumes. If Olesen is dirty, it’s because he takes the culturally constructed boundaries that separate man from woman, gay from straight, normal from abnormal, and dirties them up. He queers all that is fixed and organized and replaces it with the dissolved and the disorganized—the polysexual. <br><br>For the artist, norms are nothing but bureaucracies that get in the way. <br><br>Olesen likes to tell the story of Simeon Solomon, a Pre-Raphaelite painter in late 19th-century England who was repeatedly arrested for having sex with other men in public restrooms. Despite the criminalization of homosexuality, and despite having been arrested several times, Solomon kept having sex with other men in public restrooms. “He acted on desire as opposed to obedience,” Olesen notes, and it’s thanks to this excess, this uncontainable drive, and this confrontation with a hostile authority that he could construct his sexual self-awareness—one that emerges from a Hegelian master–slave dialectic.<br><br><i>Hysterical Men 1</i> and <i>Hysterical Men 2</i> (2013) are filled with masters and slaves, although it’s difficult to tell them apart. The two large-scale pieces on unstretched canvas are each more than 20 feet long and include scattered and fragmented images of celebrities and other headline-making figures of notoriety, including Tony Blair, Dominique StraussKahn, popes Benedict XVI and Francis, club DJ icon Ron Hardy, Chelsea Manning, Monica Lewinsky, and Karima El Mahroug (aka Ruby Rubacuori), the Moroccan escort involved with Berlusconi, among many others. Nearby, T-shirts lie in boxes, featuring some of the depicted fragments, and are available to be purchased by anyone who would like to wear them on their own bodies. The works underline the many ways that scandal and indiscretion run through the veins of leadership and power—an apt portrait set against the backdrop of the recent American presidential election, where the lines between law and lawless-ness have proven impossible to enforce or even understand. As you read this, CNN and Breitbart are both busy generating a confused American self-consciousness where masters and slaves endlessly swap places.<br><br>Please forgive the interruption, but as I write this, it’s hard not to think of the artist Zoe Leonard’s poem <i>I Want a President</i> (1992). Here is an excerpt:<br><br><i>I want a dyke for president. I want a person with AIDS for president and I want a fag for vice president and I want someone with no health insurance and I want someone who grew up in a place where the earth is so saturated with toxic waste that they didn’t have a choice about getting leukemia. I want a president that had an abortion at sixteen and I want a candidate who isn’t the lesser of two evils and I want a president who lost their last lover to AIDS, who still sees that in their eyes every time they lay down to rest, who held their lover in their arms and knew they were dying. I want a president with no air-conditioning, a president who has stood in line at the clinic, at the DMV, at the welfare office, and has been unemployed and laid off and sexually harassed and gaybashed and deported.</i><br><br>To see the <i>Hysterical Men</i> works will require taking a walk—the works create an abstract tale of fragments told over the course of 40 feet. The entire exhibition, in fact, is conceived, constructed, and even titled as a walk, a reference to <i>The Walk</i>, a 1917 novella by the Swiss author (and recluse) Robert Walser about a poet who wanders through an unnamed countryside and chronicles his encounters with various people— a professor, a banker, a bookseller, a former actress. The exchanges seem minor but become symbols of larger ideas in the narrative, which often equates walking with the act of creation. <br><br>Next stop: screw paintings. The screw is usually slave to the screwdriver, which determines where it goes and how it behaves. Olesen loosens that grip and fixes his metal screws onto canvas with thick sticky globs of glue instead. Sexual innuendo aside (although it’s clearly not meant to be put aside), the objects are left naked and only marginally contained, as if they had been released from serving a function within a larger system and allowed to speak for themselves. They are free to be connected to both pain and pleasure.<br><br><i>I understand things through contradictions. I like to argue with myself.</i> (Olesen)<br><br>Then comes darkness. In 2016, Olesen made a series of collages on wood panels inspired by the first few lines of Dante’s <i>Inferno</i>, which describes being lost in a dark forest—<i>savage, rough, and stern</i>. The four black-on-black collages, <i>1</i>, <i>2</i>, <i>3</i>, and <i>4</i> (2016), each feature black images printed on transparent sheets that have been stapled onto wood painted black, and while they appear muted in their imagery, they are biting in their affect. They contain but conceal all that is kept underground—the nasty, the twisted, the vulgar, the fucked up. They are the dungeons of the show.<br><br>Collage, more generally, is central not only to Olesen’s way of working but to his way of thinking. Collage is when all that is bi- becomes poly-. It collapses information, injecting ambivalence and disjuncture into it. Like William Burroughs’s cut-ups, collage makes language dirty, in both the erotic and the distorted sense. Olesen’s work insists that one can be reductive while also being generative—his is a productive politics of refusal.<br><br>Finally, the onion is fully peeled and we arrive at the center of the exhibition and the end of the walk. But Olesen doesn’t peel onions the same way Freud does. In his work, screwing mom and killing dad is not what’s at the end of the road— that would be far too symmetrical. He sides with Michel Foucault instead, who once quoted the 19th-century neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot as saying: “The father is sometimes just as unbearable as the mother: it is best, then, to get rid of them both.”<br><br>The last room is one made of wood, almost a shed. Inside are new works, raw materials, and vibrant colors that the artist has assembled during a month-long stay in San Francisco. It is a fully undefined space of self-invention. It is no one else’s property but his.<br><br>Sex, like dirt, is everywhere. It’s practically kitsch. It’s “in the way a bureaucrat fondles his records, a judge administers justice, a businessman causes money to circulate; the way the bourgeoisie fucks the proletariat; and so on.” (Deleuze & Guattari)<br><br>The battleground for subjectivity, in other words, is not on street marches but within the body itself. To work against the violent regulations set forth by the biopower of capitalism, it is our gestures, urges, and languages that need to disobey. Olesen’s work aims to re-complicate the body and scramble its codes by recombining it according to a different (and even invented) set of norms and boundaries. Autonomy, the artist has written, arises from desire—a place where no standards have inscribed themselves.<br><br><i>Suddenly, the desire to take a walk came over me. I put my hat on my head, left my writing room, or room of phantoms, and ran down the stairs to hurry out onto the street.</i> (Robert Walser)<br><br>*<br><br>Henrik Olesen (b. 1967, Denmark) lives and works in Berlin.

And whoever picks it up from the ground has proof that she, too, was there.<br> <br>Candy Jernigan picked all sorts of things up from the ground. Her work tells the story of a life spent turning details into evidence and, by extension, into poetic bits of social commentary. While she would often incorporate those objects in collages or attach them to the pages of her diaristic travel journals, she would also bring them back to her studio and draw them. As representations, they stop being physical evidence but become something closer to a diagram or a record.<br> <br>Just as there is a difference between reading a word and pronouncing it, Jernigan’s drawings and works on paper imbue a (discarded or rejected) physical fact with a sense of empathy and dignity.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02874.jpg\'><br><br>Evidence can come in all shapes and sizes, but Jernigan preferred the type she could pick up and put in her bag (and then, sometimes, in her freezer, a few inches away from dinner). She wasn’t interested in unique or precious “rare finds.” Instead, she was after the surplus, all that which is also already available in every corner store or on every other sidewalk. Bottles. Buttons. Luggage tags. Leaves. Bugs. Toilet paper. Cheez Doodles. She called them <i>rejectamenta</i>.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02875.jpg\'><br> <br>As a collector of evidence, Jernigan didn’t do any digging but simply picked up whatever the city coughed up on its own. She understood that a place keeps its secrets not in what it prizes but in what it rejects.<br> <br>Her city was New York City—not the current one of Whole Foods and chai lattes, but the pre-gentrified East Village and <i>Loisaida</i> of tattoo parlors and drug addicts. Much of Jernigan’s evidence came from the few blocks near her apartment, but some also came from her trips to other places: Mexico, Brazil, Ecuador, India, Italy, France, Gambia, Mali, Texas, or Cape Breton. And yet, Jernigan’s drawings don’t depict those culturally specific mementos meant to document exotic travels; they show objects she could also have found on a sidewalk on the corner of 8th and Avenue A, on her way ...<br>  ..,<br>    .,.<br>      ...<br>        ,..<br>          ,,.<br>            ...<br>              ,..<br>                ..,<br>                  ... to the laundromat. In Rome, for example, she drew a series of pop-tops from aluminum cans. During a summer in Cape Breton came <i>BUGS OF CAPE BRETON, Canada, August 83</i> (1983).<br> <br>Objects are often meaningless until they have been placed in a particular order, and when they are, even junk looks less like junk. Haim Steinbach’s sculptures place storebought <i>tchotchkes</i> and appliances next to each other in sentence-like abstractions. Robert Rauschenberg’s combines place objects on top of each other in messy accumulations. Saul Steinberg’s maps place important destinations in the foreground and unimportant ones in the far background.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02876.jpg\'><br> <br>Candy Jernigan’s drawings treat common objects as though they are uncommon specimens that require charts and annotation. Underneath the ten cans of beans in <i>THE NEW YORK COLLECTIONS, Ten Kinds of Beans (Homage to Goya)</i> (1986) are two footnotes:<br> <br>1. a city map showing where the cans came from (the city blocks, the food markets, and the aisles — aisle 3 and aisle 5)<br> <br>2. and a drawing of a body, showing where the food ultimately ended up (the mouth, the esophagus, and the stomach).<br><br><img src=\'/media/02877.jpg\'><br> <br>Other specimens require mathematical computation. Arrows and brackets accompany <i>Ham n’ Cheese</i> (1988), where ingredients are presented as three possible sets of ham and three possible sets of cheese: {a, b, c} ∩ {1, 2, 3}.<br> <br>Jernigan was born in 1952 in Miami (Florida), went to Pratt (Brooklyn), worked as a set and costume designer in Provincetown (Cape Cod), and finally moved to New York in 1980, where she worked for Paul Bacon, a book and album cover designer. In 1981, on a flight from Amsterdam back to New York, she found herself sitting next to the composer Philip Glass. They got married and lived together for ten years, until she died of liver cancer. She was only 39.<br> <br>During the last few weeks of her life, Jernigan worked late into the night on a series of watercolors. She would make five or six every night. She called them <i>Vessels</i>, and each features a single vessel—a vase, a cup, a bowl, or a pitcher—sometimes two. Each is set against a washed-out colored background, light blue, sky grey, sunset red, pale yellow, some with pulled-back curtains painted near the top two corners. The depth of field is at its bare minimum, often no more than a single line to imply a surface or a tabletop, with the object casting a slight forward shadow. They are haunting but also heartbreaking, fragile but also timeless, especially when considering her state of mind and health at the time.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02878.jpg\'><br> <br>To me, all of this work is about fragility. Bodies are fragile, drawings are fragile, memories are fragile, love is fragile, even cities are fragile. Bugs, leaves, and Cheez Doodles are fragile. If monuments or memorials are meant to counteract fragility, Jernigan chose to preserve it, even caress it, with a couple of pencils and some paper.<br><br>*<br> <br>Candy Jernigan (b. 1952, Miami; d. 1991, New York) showed her work in exhibitions at Greene Naftali Gallery in New York (2014) and Dance Theater Workshop in New York (1989 and 1985).

But for Jackson, actual things are not of great import. He is more concerned with things that <i>resemble</i> things, that feel like things, that have all the components of the thing itself, but are only connotations of things.

Cityscapes, billboards, and public art are contrasted with the inside of a home, a head. The show is a composition of images. Stitched-together theater backdrops hang like curtains, dividing the space into long corridors. Two of the gallery walls are lined with seven-foot faces, cut from old billboard vinyl. This is a certain idea of the city, the outside: tall buildings, advertisements, people.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02870.jpg\'><br><br>If it was not already apparent, this is an exhibition of faces and heads.<br><br>The term <i>façade</i> originates from a vulgar Latin word for face: <i>facia</i>. We understand it as a reference to the front of a building, its “face.” But there is also façade as false representation—an inaccurate or misleading portrayal of oneself. A mask or a veneer. A superficial appearance. A façade of wealth, or putting up a façade. <i>Fronting</i>. Actors and celebrities are in the business of façades. The closer they are to some semblance of authentic, the more convincing the front; the more deceptive the façade, the more fulfilling the lie. <br><br>Can a façade hold a person together? Is a stranger just a person with a façade? Is every face a façade and is every façade a lie? Does the cultural debris of a city construct its face? How many faces constitute a city? Whose head are we in? Is this a head that is performing as a city or a façade of a city inside of a head?<br><br>Jackson’s head is crowded with overlapping references. For this exhibition alone, he has roped in: Spike Lee’s 2002 film <i>25th Hour</i>, which depicts a devastated post-9/11 New York and a racially charged montage; <i>If I Did It</i> (2007) by Rachel Harrison, an exhibition that integrated high- and lowbrow icons and questioned the political function of art as an institutional demonstration of social progress; <i>Mobile Homestead</i> (2012) by the late Mike Kelley, a full-scale replica of the artist’s childhood home in suburban Detroit that is both public sculpture and private, personal architecture; Fashion Island, an open-air mall with circular walkways in Newport Beach; hallways.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02871.jpg\'><br><br>A selection of black-and-white photographs hangs in the back of the gallery. Some are peculiar occurrences in public art; some are documentation of Jackson in his one-bedroom apartment. His place has been the subject of past work. Like a house tends to be, it is its own world. Jackson treats this as another idea of the city, the inside: haunted, an extension of the mind.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02872.jpg\'><br><br>An executive desk presides over the show at the front of the space. It signifies a different kind of head, one of authority and power. The more deceptive the façade, the more fulfilling the lie.<br><br>Patrick Jackson (b. 1978, Los Angeles) graduated from the San Francisco Art Institute (2002) and received an MFA from the University of Southern California (2007).

Most are documentary films, but their lack of linear narrative and their extreme duration bring them closer to being history paintings.

His research for the film led him to a woman named He Fengming. He met her, he filmed her, and he realized that her story needed its own separate film.<br><br>Shot over a period of seven days, <i>Fengming, a Chinese Memoir</i> consists of a woman sitting in her living room, telling us everything she can remember about her life. It begins with her slowly walking down the street toward her apartment, up her building’s staircase, and into her home. She’s probably in her early seventies. She eventually settles down in a beige armchair, with the camera directly across from her. There is something confessional about the frame — it’s almost like a deposition, except that it’s clearly not a lawyer’s office but a domestic space with a messy coffee table.<br><br>What happens next is a nearly four-hour monologue about a thirty-year personal odyssey. Fengming had actually written a memoir a few years earlier, titled <i>1957: How I Lived It</i>, which explains the ease and fluidity with which she speaks. She begins in 1949, when, at age 17, she enthusiastically joined the Communist Revolution. Eight years later, she and her husband, Jinchao, both journalists, were deemed to be “rightist” conspirators (insubordinate intellectuals), even though she had given up her language studies to volunteer in the Communist brigades. Publicly shamed, they both went to re-education camps, with promises that the experience would rid them of their “rightist” labels. She worked in the fields and leveled land. Jinchao was sent to the brutal Jiabiangou camp in the Gobi Desert, forced to suffer even more extreme conditions because of “subversive writings” he had published. He died of hunger there, a few days before Fengming could reach him.<br><br>She continues, talking about her children, the readjustment of her life following the loss of her husband, and her militant efforts to honor his memory and write her memoir. While her survival story is a personal one, it’s also the story of China on the geopolitical scale and the realities that accompany it.<br><br>Hour after hour go by, and Fengming doesn’t even break for a drink of water. With the day turning to night, the room gradually gets darker, until she is almost completely invisible. When there’s a slight pause in her speech, Wang Bing makes the only interruption he permits himself to make: “Would you mind if we turned on the light?”<br><br>She gets up, turns the light on, sits back down, and continues.<br><br>Unlike most filmmakers, Wang Bing mostly works alone or with a small crew, uses a portable digital camera, and relies on natural lighting and ambient sound. His small budgets allow him to shoot without official authorization and remain free from any form of control or oversight. The same is true for Fengming herself: without a script, she finds herself allowed to speak freely, without censorship.<br><br>Instead of making films as a way to point fingers, avenge past injustices, or victimize his subjects, Wang Bing makes them as a way to listen. In  <i>Fengming, a Chinese Memoir </i>, there are no archival photos, no staged flashbacks, and no edits. There is just a woman who talks, a camera that listens, and a living room that gets darker and darker with the setting sun.<br><br><br><a href=\"\">Man With No Name </a><br>(2009, 94 min.)<br><br><img src=\'/media/02904.jpg\'><br><br>Wang Bing met the man with no name in 2006, while he was working on <i>The Ditch</i>. He made repeated visits to see him, in the outskirts of Beijing, spanning across all four seasons. Each time, he asked the man whether it was OK to film him but never got a response. Originally, his intention was to use the man as a character study for <i>The Ditch</i>, and he sought to capture the man’s movements, gestures, and body language, so that he could then show the footage to his actors on the set. In the end, however, it became its own film: <i>Man With No Name</i>.<br><br>Generally speaking, the telling of untold stories characterizes the work of all documentary filmmakers. Wang Bing, however, doesn’t ever say a word: <i>Man With No Name</i> simply begins, without context, without voice-over. His camera is not there to prove a point, capture a scene, or witness an event, but to do something far more challenging: to be present.<br><br>His restraint does not indicate a lack of political intent — quite the opposite. It contains a political and an ethical position with regards to how to think about and treat those who are nameless, silenced, and left behind: pay attention to them, be close to them, relinquish control over them, and follow their lead.<br><br>The man with no name lives a life <i>without</i> — without home, without name, without electricity, without running water, without company, without saying a word. As winter turns to summer and back to winter, he builds his shelter and makes his food. He collects branches, fetches water, and tends to his garden with dignity, calm, patience, and resolve. He sometimes goes to the neighboring town to collect waste, but he never begs. He seems implicitly to accept his own marginalization, and by all accounts, he is invisible. And yet, Wang Bing’s camera follows him everywhere he goes: it waits with him, it cooks with him, it walks with him, it smokes with him. Even if their lives are far apart and an inevitable distance remains lodged between them, there is a warm sense of complicity. Together, they both refuse the world outside. They refuse its laws, its systems of control, its politics, its economies, its beliefs, its people, and even its languages.<br><br><br><a href=\"\">Crude Oil</a><br>(2008, 840 min.)<br><br><img src=\'/media/02905.jpg\'><br><br>When Wang Bing set out to make <i>Crude Oil</i>, he had planned a 70-hour film, with 10 hours to be shot every day over a period of a week. Although he was forced to leave the location due to altitude sickness, the filmmaker was still able to produce an epic 14-hour film that documents the daily routines, difficulties, and leisure of a group of workers in a Gobi Desert oil field. He started filming immediately upon arrival. There are no tests for framing, sound, or light. There are no instructions or rehearsals. People never address the camera or filmmaker—Wang Bing doesn’t like to talk to the people he films. <br><br>The film begins with a group of people in a windowless room. The walls look like they’re metal, as if they were inside a shipping container. There is a loud and constant noise coming from somewhere outside. A group of men are sitting together, and others are alone. They talk about women and about money. They send text messages. They joke, they laugh, they insult, they brag, they threaten, they complain. Others try to sleep. They seem bored and exhausted by all the waiting—as if their break from work was as arduous as the work itself. Parts are very funny.<br><br>The environment is punishing and the working conditions are severe. What we see is how labor becomes impossible to distinguish from boredom, friendship from sarcasm, play from competition—but also how the forces of habit and humor provide the crucial support structure that makes self-determination still possible.<br><br>The days are long and the hours go by slowly. Handling the oil rig takes time. Waiting takes time. Playing cards and watching television takes time. The men work, they talk, and they sleep, and Wang Bing never interrupts them. If his film lasts 14 hours, it’s because he accepts and obeys the time of the other.<br><br>*<br><br>Each film is an argument against money, power, and control. Wang Bing was 22 years old when student demonstrators were brutally suppressed in Tiananmen Square in 1989, making him a member of a generation of artists who don’t shy away from political content or subtext. In the 27 years since then, China has seen a period of extraordinary economic growth, and each film Wang Bing has made memorializes the people who have been<br>overlooked by that growth. These films are about the details, how they accumulate, and how they come to determine entire lives and tell the story of entire cultures and entire ideologies. <br><br>*<br>Visit the exhibition <a href=\"/gallery/wang-bing-three-portraits-2016\">here</a>.<br><br>Download the PDF of the exhibition brochure <a href=\'/media/00777.pdf\'>here</a>.',''),(950,1,'2020-02-01 04:27:38','2020-02-15 04:43:17',4370,'On <i>Laura Owens: Ten Paintings</i>\r\nby Anthony Huberman',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'on-laura-owens-ten-paintings-by-anthony-huberman',NULL,'2016-04-28 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL,'',_binary '<i>Pick your battles</i> is usually sound advice. When it comes to painting, there are many battles to choose from: flatness versus depth, materiality versus illusion, abstraction versus representation, the epic versus the everyday, the grid versus the gesture. Laura Owens picks them all, and plays both sides. In the words of one critic, Owens is like Mondrian in drag. She self-consciously <i>overperforms</i> the act and the idea of painting. She makes paintings that look like paintings.<br><br>Owens has described painting as onomatopoeic—like <i>hiccup</i>, <i>splash</i>, and <i>meow</i>—because it contains that to which it refers. Contextualization, content, and aesthetics aside, a painting is always already art. As soon as we see one, we know what to do and recognize it as art. Even the unprimed stretched canvas for sale at Walmart is a signifier of art, before any marks are made on its surface. Objects, images, or videos need a frame or a context in order for them to <i>seem</i> like art. Painting doesn’t. <br><br>If a museum helps objects become art, then hanging a painting in a museum is like turning into art something that’s already art. It’s like calling a hiccup a hiccup.<br><br>For Owens, this opens up a place for irony in the Shakespearian sense of a play within a play, where the audience understands that actors are acting as actors. Her paintings, in that sense, are paintings performing the role of paintings. <br><br>But the difference between performance and overperformance is an important one. While both are calculated interventions within the logic of painting, the latter incorporates the use of humor in the form of caricature, irony, or perversity. More than being <i>funny</i>, there is always something <i>wrong</i> in a Laura Owens painting. Her images are childish but too monumental to be for children; they are abstract but too full of language to be speechless; they are pretty but too impolite to please everyone; they are bright but too obscure to be Pop; they are hung on the wall but too sculptural to remain there; and they are huge but not made by a man.<br><br>Many like to quote Owens when she says she “wants paintings to be a problem” or, more specifically, that she’s interested in painting that “comes out into the room, almost punches you in the face,” and is “confrontational.” <br><br>While each of those is an accurate description of Owens’ work, they also leave out some important nuances. For example, when asked her thoughts on Jeff Koons’s work, she referred to a model she once met, who had “no mole or misaligned tooth.” While it’s true that Koons’s paintings of La Cicciolina are certainly confrontational, they lack an imperfection that would make them “impolite.” They’re not quite—what’s the word—<i>embarrassing</i> enough?<br><br>A useful example of Owens’s take on the impolite is her recent series of artist books based on spam emails. Like a porn star, spam is often crass and in-your-face, appealing to the lowest common denominator—although, unlike sex, it is an annoyance more than anything else. Spam is also, Owens discovered, often completely useless: in attempting to purchase the merchandise advertised in these emails, the artist found that often nothing was actually for sale and the products were nonexistent inventions. Therein is the misaligned tooth, the exposed embarrassment. Therein is the overperformance: an annoying in-box interruption that is in fact doubly annoying. It’s an impolite impolite piece of spam, a sales pitch that doesn’t actually sell anything.<br><br>Many tag Owens’s work as “Painting 2.0.” Not only does she use Photoshop to make her compositions, the argument goes, but they even <i>look</i> Photoshopped, what with all the erasures and drop shadows. Spam, of course, comes through email and is distributed via algorithms. Owens also recently made a series of emoji sculptures. And why else would she paint cats, if not because they are so popular on Instagram? <br><br>But there is nothing “virtual” about her work. Unlike the layers that can appear and disappear with the click of a mouse, hers are physically <i>there</i>. They sometimes involve fifty applications of gesso, or objects attached to the surface of a canvas (bicycle wheels, laser-cut wood, clock parts). Scanners, silkscreens, scissors, cloths, paper, computers, projectors, masking tape, several different kinds of paint, brushes, palette knives, melamine tabletops, walls, and the concrete floor of her studio—that’s what it takes to make a single piece.<br><br>Owens often forces painting to perform tasks other than painting. Some canvases contain the battery-powered hands of a clock, even if they don’t tell the time. Others suddenly emit sound. Many contain text. Some look like screens, others look like paper. Most are conceived with a specific site in mind.<br><br>In a recent exhibition in Berlin, Owens’s paintings stood upright in the middle of the gallery. They came off the walls, were attached to the floor, and were installed in a staggered line. A viewer who stood in a specific spot with the right line of sight would recognize a text that ran across all five paintings. <br><br>These were paintings of sheets of notebook paper. Their installation made them into successive pages, albeit much larger and more sculptural than any notebook. <i>Untitled</i> (2014), shown at MoMA in 2014, is a single painting that also incorporates the same notebook paper. <i>Untitled</i> (2014), shown at the Whitney Biennial, was based on a motivational poster from the 1970s. Another recent body of work began with old newspaper layouts the artist found under the siding of her house. <br><br>Paper has been creeping into Laura Owens’s work.<br><br>If painting is supposedly priceless, paper is decidedly not—it’s common and cheap. Painting is forever, paper is not. Paper is for drawings, doodles, sketches, or notes. Paper therefore demands and instills a distance from painting. It makes sense that Owens would be drawn to it. <br><br>In Berlin, Owens separated her paintings (of sheets of paper) from the walls. In San Francisco, she does the reverse: the paintings <i>are</i> the walls.<br><br>Wall + Paper = Wallpaper. Completely covering the gallery walls are more than seventy unique, non-repeating strips of handmade wallpaper— paintings made on clay-coated paper with silkscreened patterns, process color images, charcoal and sand flocking, and hand painting. Greatly enlarged images of creased, folded and torn paper appear as a bitmap pattern beneath images of actual-size architectural details from the artist’s studio, her grandmother’s embroidery, of drawings her brother made as a child, a Sister Corita Kent postcard, old emails, classified ads from vintage copies of <i>The Berkeley Barb</i>, and details from the artist’s own previous work. These images often seem to hang on the wall with <i>trompe l’œil</i> shadows. Text messages sent to the wallpaper trigger a sound component. In places, the wallpaper pretends to reveal a space behind the wall itself—as if wallpaper had been placed on top of a wall that had more paper behind it. The mural is divided by images of Tudor-style wooden beams that correlate in places to the actual architecture of the exhibition space. Done at this scale, it’s not “interior decoration” but is an epic mural, which, like most murals, interacts and overlaps with its site. <br><br>This self-reflexive doubling, the act of placing art on top of art, echoes throughout Owens’s work. It appears visually, with drop shadows placed on top of drop shadows and lemons on top of lemons. It appears physically, with one painting continuing or picking up on a pattern or phrase begun by another painting elsewhere in the room. It appears in the way her books are meant to be seen as paintings and her paintings are meant to be read as books. It appears linguistically, with wallpaper made of walls and paper, or with sight aligning with site.<br><br>Laura Owens feeds painting its own tail so that it ties itself up in knots. She stresses it, distorts it, and laughs at it. <br><br>This is an exhibition of paintings of paper with paper paintings of paper patterns on painted paper performing as painting. Paintings of paintings hang in a second gallery.<br><br>*<br><br>Laura Owens (b. 1970, Euclid, Ohio) lives and works in Los Angeles.

The surfaces are scrutinized, the edges are caressed, each detail is perfected, and yet the metaphors remain abstract and the origin stories never clear. They seem to be the work of a lover, a dreamer, a carpenter, and an engineer all rolled into one.<br><br>Imagine a piece of cold industrial machinery waking up with one foot on the wrong side of the bed. It’s tired but agitated. Its corners have curled up, like an animal showing its teeth or its feathers. It feels distraught but not timid—resolved to finding a way to overcome whatever is spoiling its mood. Its fate, however, remains far from secure.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02891.jpg\'><br><br>Imagine minimalism falling in love with surrealism. It can only end tragically.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02892.jpg\'><br><br>Blatrix exchanges one type of abstraction for another: unstable emotional states become hand-sculpted wooden, plastic, or aluminum forms. His use of abstraction leads objects astray, and specific references become ambivalent ones. For example, if a phone call once ended a relationship with a lover, the artist might use a telephone as a starting point to fabricate a series of amorphous curved shapes. Abstraction, in that sense, is a place objects go to disappear.<br><br><i>Heroe</i> is the name of this exhibition, and <i>Heroe</i> needs help. It needs maintenance. It needs the comfort of a holding hand—<i>main</i> (hand) <i>tenir</i> (to hold). Each of its sculptures, in order to perform its supposed function, depends on another sculpture—the way a machine depends on a mechanic and a mechanic depends on a toolbox.<br><br>(Maintenance is like DNA: it determines and conditions every single object, body, and relationship on earth. The difference between function and dysfunction is a question of maintenance.)<br><br><img src=\'/media/02893.jpg\'><br><br>This exhibition seems to be suspended or stuck in place—each sculpture is waiting to be maintained by another and therefore unable to maintain a third. <br><br>They are not <i>broken</i>, they are <i>waiting</i>—there’s a difference.<br><br>Nervously rocking back and forth in a corner of the room is something between a beached whale and a robotic vacuum cleaner.

The artist calls them “emotional objects.” <br><br>Tickets, intercoms, and mailboxes, while obviously inanimate and completely ordinary, aren’t actually faceless because they involve a <i>someone</i>: we buy a ticket to go visit someone, we buzz the doorbell to see someone, we wait for a letter from someone. Each object, despite being itself incapable of expressing an emotion, has the power of making or breaking a relationship. As sculptures, however, the objects are separated from their <i>someone</i>. Instead, they are orphans—abstracted, marooned, and in need of a story.  <br><br><img src=\'/media/02894.jpg\'><br><br><i>Heroe</i> is a story about objects in desperate need of a hero—a someone who can save them from their state of temporary paralysis and disrepair.

Fried’s archive of work engages in a range of subjects, both personal and philosophical, linked by an unceasing accumulation of critical and practical questions that arise during the realization of projects. The genesis of an idea may be simple but Fried submits to these unexpected questions at any stage of a work’s development, with his artistic objectives undergoing daily scrutiny and adjustment. What is at stake is not so much a work’s completion as its <i>resolution</i>, an attempt to minimize the discrepancies between the material development of each work and its internal logics or intended effects. <br><br>Conflicts regularly arise between Fried’s demands on his works and the conditions essential for their public display. Such conflicts are not framed negatively but instead become integral psychological devices in many of his installations and performances. Annoyances that might usually remain suppressed or unspoken, such as social dynamics between his collaborators,<sup>1</sup> or personal administrative duties,<sup>2</sup> become important catalysts to the assembly of his work. This approach often necessitates dramatic material changes to projects in mid-production and has led to multiple iterations of the same piece, as with <i>Derelict V</i>, a new large-scale architectural installation that is shown here for the first time but is also a continuation of Fried’s series <i>Derelict</i> (1974-1983). <br><br><i>Derelict</i> plays upon contrasting scales and paradoxical perspectives of the same simple tableau: a coffee cup resting upon a flat surface. The first time the piece was installed (at San Jose State University’s art gallery in 1974), a large cylindrical form<sup>3</sup> protruded from a white wall, intersecting with the tiled floor of the gallery. A small photograph of a coffee cup, easily identifiable by its handle, was installed across from this abstract architectural element. This photograph provided the basis of the work: the architectural form was, in fact, an oversized representation of the same coffee cup, which was installed at exactly the opposite viewpoint to the one provided by the photograph. <br><br><img src=\'/media/02884.jpg\'><br><br>A meticulously calculated and invisible axis of perspective existed in the relation between photograph and architectural form, and it is this axis that mobilized Fried’s central provocation: <i>upon viewing the photograph, you would be on the axis from where the picture was taken from, of the space you are in, but from a vantage point that doesn’t exist in that same space, so it’s like an overview of your situation from a place you can’t get to. So that was the premise. And I guess I probably considered that to be some kind of definition of the <a href=””>derelict condition</a>.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br><img src=\'/media/02885.jpg\'><br><br><img src=\'/media/02886.jpg\'><br><br><i>Derelict V</i> is the latest addition to the series, coming 33 years after the last installation and featuring many of the details described in the original version. As is typical for each new iteration of <i>Derelict</i>, Fried has made a number of conspicuous modifications. Most noticeably, no photograph is installed, replaced instead by two eyeholes that reveal life-size tabletops and cups; the printed image is removed in favor of an entirely three-dimensional encounter. Components and materials from the four previous (and distinct) works from the <i>Derelict</i> series are also on view.<br><br>The “derelict condition” that Fried describes is one that he considers a universal component of all artistic enterprise. When creating an overview of a particular artwork—setting its goals, establishing its rules, anticipating its intellectual and affective properties—artists must objectify their own intentions. These objectives immediately trigger a separate life for the very same project, one that is grounded by the contrarian practical realities of fabricating the artwork. For Fried it would be a sham to conceal or ignore this inevitable splitting effect that is driven by the unexpected associations and deviations of thought that accompany the manifestation of any project. His is a methodology premised on volatility and mutation. Fried places himself in service of his own concepts, which are so often characterized by their unrest and idealism, and this responsibility is upheld at all costs.<br><br><i>Of the many noble quests undertaken by an artist, none seems as challenging as the use of art to probe itself. The slow and casual unlayering of the beast, rib by rib, joint by joint, it is in every sense a journey crowed by tunnels, blind alleys, mock impulses and divergent crossroads. Howard Fried’s urges sent him into this terrain.</i> <br>–Dennis Oppenheim<sup>5</sup><br><br><i>Derelicts</i> presents work both in progress and historical, without seeking to establish a priority between the two. A small selection of works, including two early videos—<i>Condom</i> (1975) and <i>Intraction</i> (1973)—provide further examples of Fried’s vigorously non-linear investigations into the dynamics of authority and decision-making.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02887.jpg\'><br><br>Fried is in relentless pursuit of those fruitful paradoxes (the “derelict condition”) that can be sustained so vividly by artmaking. In his absolute demand that personal intuition be valued above all else, constraints such as budget and time—problems that belong to the institutions in partnership with him—must never dictate the tempo or direction of his own process. The precision of Fried’s imaginative and technical efforts is made possible by a basic but tenaciously held conviction: his own intuitions must be prioritized above the needs of institution or even audience. This principle extends into <i>Derelicts</i>, which is subject to continued alteration by Fried, who considers the works on display (in particular those from the <i>Derelict</i> series) pliable and open to augmentations throughout the course of their public presentation.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02888.jpg\'><br><br><img src=\'/media/02889.jpg\'><br><br>Notes<br>(1) In his performance <i>Synchromatic Baseball</i> (1971), Fried organized two teams according to a framework that designated each player as having either dominant or passive tendencies within particular social relationships (the specifics of which were never disclosed). <br>(2) In 2007, under instructions to provide a syllabus for a class he was teaching at the San Francisco Art Institute, Fried wrote an excoriating text asserting that his syllabus, its “preamble,” and the contents of the class itself, were all artworks whose status should be considered in isolation from the “Frankensteinish” nature of the art school’s “accrediting politburo.”<br>(3) The original cylinder remains a component within <i>Derelict V.</i><br>(4) Howard Fried, interview by the author, July 2016.<br>(5) Press release for <i>Deep Skin Excursion – Early Work</i> by Howard Fried, curated by Dennis Oppenheim, Apexart, New York, 1997.<br><br>*<br><br>Howard Fried (b. 1946 in Cleveland) lives and works in Vallejo.

This type of detail may conjure personal memories, like the way drugstores and one-hour photo shops in the 1980s and 1990s would print doubles, but it also relates to the artist’s engagement with theoretical ideas. Here identical twin images reference a traditional Japanese New Year’s decoration, <i>kagami mochi</i>, that symbolizes the idea of a mirror, as well as a western philosophical concept of time in which past and present are intertwined.<br><br><i>Division and Revision #2</i> (2016) <br>These two (almost identical) photographs depict colored liquor and wine bottles placed on a three-tiered stand. Most likely taken decades ago, these enlarged reprints divide the space in half. <br><br><i>Mirrors</i> (2016) <br>A pair of identical mirrors forms an alter ego for the photographs. Placed side-by-side, they repeat the reality of the photographs ad infinitum, just like mirrors placed face-to-face.<br><br><i>Table Stella</i> (2016) <br>These three pairs of tables are produced in three distinct sizes with reflective steel legs. Each tabletop is made of an enlarged version of a pair of appropriated photographs. Ashtrays made from natural material are scattered across the tabletops like a constellation, partially obscuring the image. <br><br><i>Table Matematica</i> (2016) <br>A black granite table is crowded with bottles of Jägermeister in 13 distinct sizes. The bottles are recognizable by their branding, and the only apparent difference between them is their size. Although Jägermeister evokes a unique flavor, it is not accessible here. <br><br>The title of the exhibition, <i>Inhuman Transformation of New Year’s Decoration, Obsolete Conception or 2</i>, is replete with references. Kimura’s work rarely depicts people, and when it does, they are often obscured by plants or other impediments. The use of the word <i>inhuman</i> suggests a philosophical concern beyond the human condition and also refers to the camera, which is often described as inhuman, the perfect confluence of technology and thought. Following that trajectory, <i>obsolete conception</i> may be a nod to philosophical ideas that seem antiquated but that have laid the foundation for more contemporary theories. <br><br>Opening in late 2016 and ending in early 2017, the entire exhibition acts as a New Year’s decoration.<br><br>*<br><br>Yuki Kimura (b. 1971, Kyoto, Japan) lives and works in Berlin.

There is the rapist, the alcoholic parent, or the depressed loner and his machine gun. <br><br>I could go on.<br><br>But the way ordinary people behave in their everyday lives is just as terrifying. We conform and follow norms. We believe what we’re told. We produce and we consume. We allow standardization to take over. We Google. We Facebook. <br><br>We’re all so goddamn <i>obedient</i>. Even those who disagree or misbehave are part of the program—dissent is a necessary part of any dialectic.<br><br>In an article published in São Paulo’s <i>O Diário</i> newspaper in 1966, Vilém Flusser writes, “I do not have free will; I am not free. I am a functionary of programs that are alien to me; I am an instrument. Not being free I do not surprise. I am predictable. History (as a flux of surprising and unpredictable happenings) has been overcome. I function within a post-historical situation, a messianic situation, I am in paradise. The lack of surprise, the lack of an unprogrammed future is unbearable. Paradise is unbearable. It bores and nauseates me. I must rebel. Can I rebel? I believe I can. The sensation of boredom and nausea that the programs cause in me are experiential proof that I am not completely programmed.”<br><br>I know of no better description of the work of Jos de Gruyter & Harald Thys. <br><br><img src=\'/media/02908.jpg\'><br><br>Like Flusser, de Gruyter & Thys are critical of a contemporary subjectivity that has been beaten into submission by norms, conventions, and expectations. To them, Western civilization is drowning in the infinite regress of predictable stereotypes and ready-made behavior patterns. Driving around the well-organized and efficient towns of the Flemish Region or nearby Germany, for example, all they see is an over-regulated world where humans are almost redundant.<br><br>In response, they do what any good artist would do when faced with a problem: they make it worse.<br><br><i>Tram 3</i>, the title of their exhibition, refers to one of the first tramlines in Antwerp, which links, in their words, “the worst neighborhood to the worst neighborhood.” <br><br>It also refers to the Flemish right-wing party, whose members describe themselves as being on Tram 3 when they have 30 percent of the popular vote and therefore consider themselves to be on the right track—which is another way of linking something bad with something worse.<br><br>De Gruyter & Thys imagine their films, drawings, sculptures, and photographs as bearing witness to a present moment that’s descended into a state of mechanized stupidity. As a result, the works often look a bit shocked, offended, disgusted, distant, and traumatized, but always poised and ready for more. All are speechless, even the characters in the videos, choosing to keep a distance from the language of humans and trusting only the friendship of objects. The artists call them <i>immobilized</i>: “You can see this occur in animals who are confronted with some bizarre opponent, another (bigger) animal, a human, or a combination of both.”<br><br>Their works are tragic, comic, and silent portraits of the human condition. They are <i>deadpan</i>, in all senses of the word: funny and blank at the same time. They taste like cardboard.<br><br>For example, the <i>White Elements</i> (2015) might once have been warm-blooded bodies, but they have become flattened into rigid sheets of steel. They are statues of stick figures, standing nine feet tall and eight millimeters thick, creating the silhouette of a body—or the bare minimum of one, like the pixelated approximation from an old Atari game. <br><br><img src=\'/media/02907.jpg\'><br><br>Pencil drawings of faces (traced from anonymous images found online) are pinned to the top of each one, forming a fragile but persistent link to the world of humans but ultimately sabotaging the weight of a statue with the weightlessness of a cartoon.<br><br>Twenty-five drawings, <i>Public Transport</i> (2013), depict a range of trams or trolley cars that sit stubbornly still, preferring not to move. The people sitting on the trams seem to live entirely inside their own heads.<br><br>John Cage’s famous phrase comes to mind: “I have nothing to say and I’m saying it.” But in the case of these drawings, and of the people and trams they contain, the opposite is true: they have something to say and they’re not saying it.<br><br>Their newest video, <i>Die Aap van Bloemfontein</i> [<i>The Ape from Bloemfontein</i>] (2014), is another heavy blow of speechlessness and sheer eventlessness, but this time with such bright colors and intimate close-ups that it manages to also feel heartfelt and vulnerable. A voice, speaking in Afrikaans, narrates a story of surreal transformations (once again: found online): Jaap the chicken was also a monkey, who had a computer, that was actually a lawnmower, on which he watched TV. <br><br>Set atop successive scenes of immobilized human figures, the text becomes the cartoon animation, performing exuberant flips and mutations, since the characters prove unable to do so. Instead, they look <i>stunned</i>, like ancient archeological treasures displaced into a new world.<br><br>Five framed watercolors accompany the film and are almost demonic in their simplicity.<br><br>It’s rumored that Charlie Chaplin worried that cartoons would put him out of a job because they would always be better at performing feats of physical comedy. Any wooden spoon, for instance, could easily stand up, go for a walk, light up a cigarette, set itself on fire, burn to the ground, and get back up again, unharmed. <br><br>Jos de Gruyter & Harald Thys might agree, but for different reasons. To them, objects, puppets, or animals will win because they are far more skilled at coping with boredom, vulgarity, embarrassment, and powerlessness. They don’t suffer if they look ugly or if they come across as rude. They simply don’t want or value the same things we do, and for de Gruyter and Thys, what people want matters much less than what objects want.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02909.jpg\'><br><br>Laughter, Henri Bergson argued, is less about sympathy or kindness than it is about humiliation and domination. As such, humor is an irritant: a mixture of pain and joy that is capable of disarming logical and rational thought. <br><br>That space between pain and joy is brutal but still funny, populated by Louis C. K.’s jokes, Bruce Nauman’s tortured clowns, or 4chan’s /b/ board. It’s a place of pathos and perversion that a civilized bourgeoisie can’t digest. De Gruyter & Thys use it to help the powerless caricature the powerful.<br><br>In J. G. Ballard’s novel <i>Millennium People</i> (2003), residents of a middle-class suburban town outside London pursue liberal educations and applaud civic responsibility. One character, Kay, sees it as a prison full of constraints:<br><br>“Try getting drunk at a school speech day, or making a mildly racist joke at a charity dinner. Try letting your lawn grow and not painting your house for a few years. Try living with a teenage girl or having sex with your stepson. Try saying you believe in God and the Holy Trinity, or giving a free room to a refugee family from black Africa. Try taking a holiday in Benidorm, or driving a brand-new Cadillac with zebra upholstery. Try bad taste.”<br><br>Jos de Gruyter & Harald Thys are drawn to all that society can’t digest or domesticate—the people, ideas, places, experiences, gestures, habits, images, and objects that exist in the margins and that any mainstream culture will always find hard to swallow. <br><br>In a cultural context where change happens quickly and loudly, their work sits still and stays mute and warns of the exhaustion and immobility that comes with speed, efficiency, and communication.<br><br>*<br><br>Jos de Gruyter (b. 1965, Geel, Belgium) and Harald Thys (b. 1966, Wilrijk, Belgium) live and work in Brussels and have been working together since 1987.

The model freight train that it carries is defaced with graffiti and allows visitors to ride past a series of photographs on the walls that enclose its path. Moving amid these elements, in a manner both fluid and awkward, are various transmissions of text and image. <br><br>The exhibition’s title sounds like a statement, but its voice is ambiguous and addresses an unknown subject. The title is laid out on the gallery wall in a graphic style alien to its surrounding context, the words rendered as image, much like the spray-painted “tags” that adorn the train. Photographs of hands seem to wave on the train, in communication with one another as well as with the objects that they touch. <br><br>“<i>To more than misquote Godard: language is (not) the smartphone we live in. . . .</i>” [JP]<br><br>The photographs in this exhibition depict hands touching and in contact with various materials: a chest, a phone, a touch-sensitive lamp base, an iPad. <br><br>When considered together, these images seem to propose a language of the body defined only by palms and fingers. Using a macro lens, Pryde documents the haptic moment between a human body and the objects with which it seeks to engage. The heads of the bodies are always out of frame, and perhaps this speaks to the present moment, a time in which our hands do at least some of the thinking for us.<br><br>These images act as a potential record of how hands are being used today and become a close analysis of a new body semiotics that have arrived with “smart” technologies. <br><br>Micro-gestures that extend the human body into limitless access to virtual content are shot in close-up angles, the hands scaled much larger than life-size. <br><br>Can what we call virtual content also reach back into the parts of our lives we might otherwise consider non-virtual?<br><br>Pryde’s most recent works in this series depict Christmas presents that two of her dealers had sent her the preceding two years. <br><br>Each gift from both galleries was almost identical from one year to the next, and all four presents have comparable traits and functions.<br><br>The gifts are shot in the same way as the props in the other photographs and also are placed in contact with hands. <br><br>These images make an association between the material device of each gift and the nature of the gift as a device itself, insofar as they can acknowledge a site of exchange traversed by real attachments. <br><br>At the center of Pryde’s exhibition is a fully functioning ride-on model train that can slowly carry passengers—at about 2 miles per hour—along a point-to-point track. <br><br>The train, a freight locomotive and two boxcars, is painted in the Union Pacific livery and covered in the patina of miniaturized graffiti.<br><br>The presence of a freight train could indicate a classic image of the American artist-journeyman, traveling broke and on her own timeline, or could point to some of the most iconic cultural imagery of the past century in the United States, whether it be the destitute hobo hitching a free ride or the aggressive expansion of industrialization across the country. <br><br>Anyone is welcome to ride the train. Please ask at the front desk.<br><br>Pryde often approaches her exhibitions with allegorical, even quasi-narrative, installations and exaggerates the spatial and perceptual relations between artwork, institution, and audience. <br><br>In museums and cultural centers, the mediation of art to the public is becoming increasingly contingent upon ideas of “interactivity” and “fun,” two concepts that are accommodated here with a certain sense of bathos. <br><br>The train is modeled after a real locomotive, but its scale and restricted route cannot convey or reproduce a full-size experience. <br><br>Viewers are offered the chance to daydream a little as they travel the short distance past the photographs that hang on the gallery walls. <br><br>This train, like many freight trains around the world, is “bombed” with graffiti, a visual language that has historically been one of resistance to the sanitization and privatization of urban space but that is now a favored aesthetic of urban planners and corporate executives alike. <br><br>There remains, however, an insistence that particular freedoms can be won through the act of writing, especially on trains, which distribute those self-determined actions along the routes of their timetabled paths. <br><br>Is the “I” in the exhibition title to be understood as the clear-minded summit of self-expression? Or is that “I” a self-policing ideal of social acceptance that obstructs creative thought? Or can that “I” just be stumbling around, thinking, in a state of awareness that is joyously and necessarily incomplete and dim?<br><br>All of us, including artists, are required to represent ourselves, both in the arena of our personal lives and in the various interpersonal networks that constitute our professional careers. But artists are perhaps especially subject to the consequences of their formal, social, and commercial decisions and are required to be in perpetual dialogue with exterior perceptions of their name, one that banners both their personhood and their artwork.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02895.jpg\'><br><br>Josephine Pryde is an artist whose work has long sought to find a common treatment of photography’s two dominant historical uses: scientific analysis and artistic endeavor. <br><br>Perhaps the key distinguishing factor between images of science and art is the position and prominence of a photograph’s author. A preconceived idea of an artist being in control of the photographic process allows lens-based imagery to seem deliberate and steered in how it delivers meaning for an awaiting public. <br><br>Without the artist, photographs can distribute different kinds of meaning: evidential and fact-making, these process-driven images are executed without the cloudy compromise of a maker’s subjectivity. Such binaries are, in reality, a bankrupt expression of how photographs undergo technical, stylistic, and political developments in their production. <br><br>Photography has, since its earliest iterations, produced various approaches for different causes, and these distinct approaches quickly plundered techniques from one another, whether in the fields of anthropology, medicine, or advertising.<br><br>Nevertheless, the context of an image and the definition of its experience as either one of culture or of information are often designated by the presence, or absence, of its artistic author. <br><br>Pryde’s work seems to insist repeatedly that the process of mapping and securing a site of cultural value—and its profound link to the artistic ego—is what divides and hierarchizes particular images and their publics.<br><br>*<br><br>Josephine Pryde (b. 1967, Alnwick, UK) lives and works in Berlin and London.

Most of these works are made of metal, but they contain an agency usually reserved for sentient beings, prodding and sensing their environment the way a bacterium might explore its host.<br><br>K.r.m. Mooney has titled this exhibition <i>En, Set</i>. Strictly speaking, an en-set is a pneumatic tool used in engraving and stone setting. More loosely, “en” is a prefix — a fragment that can lodge itself inside of other words and move them around with altered or adjusted meanings: encircle, engage, encompass, entrap, encase. Jewelers might use the second term, when they “set” a stone to situate it in a specific location within another material. As an exhibition title, <i>En, Set</i> announces a series of abstract attachments : a setting where material fragments will fit within each other and form something else.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02896.jpg\'><br><br>Proximity is messy. Separate elements, whether natural or cultural, just don’t quietly sit next to each other. Instead, they coalesce in a process of alignment, attachment, and migration, giving rise to emergent properties that exceed the sum of any parts. Regardless of what you might think, one plus one never equals two.<br><br>In quantum terms, this is known as <i>entanglement</i>, and in ontological terms, as <i>difference</i>, and it is the way we have come to describe the nature of all systems. It has complicated the mechanistic notion of cause-and-effect, since it inserts a fundamental contingency within the fabric of any relationship. In this sense, even machines don’t only do what we think they do, but are more like bodies or ecosystems — habitats where certain actions are possible and where materials infect and invade each other and their environment. The hard part lies is deciding where matter stops and where its environment begins.<br><br>K.r.m. Mooney points toward the porousness of those boundaries. More specifically, the artist is interested in what happens when objects, bodies, and spaces intersect: that place where bits of matter pass through, inside, around, and near each other, thereby becoming <i>of</i> each other.<br><br>In Mooney’s studio are several books by feminist theorist Karen Barad. “Bodies,” one underlined passage goes, “are not situated <i>in</i> the world, they are part <i>of</i> the world.” The distinction may seem subtle, but when it sinks in, it neutralizes any distance that separates humans from any animal, object, or subatomic particle that makes the world what it is — all are contaminated by the others.<br><br>Trained as a jeweler, Mooney imagines the way objects come into contact with bodies but considers questions a jeweler might not ask: Do steel, plants, floors, rhythms, circles, salt, minimalism, airflow, vulnerability, limbs, and foxtails all want something from each other? How do they impose on each other, but also belong together and even learn to coexist? The very notion of <i>identity</i> becomes impossible to track — all that’s left are possible actions, kinships, and affinities.<br><br>Take, for example, a piece of electrical conduit. It’s a classic postindustrial material: composed of repeating units of vinyl chloride (C2H3Cl), it forms a strong synthetic resin that is cheap and reliable. Then, say, loop some vinyl grafting ribbon around it, hook it onto a flat strip of steel, tie a silver-plated cast of a lavender branch to it, attach clarinet keys to it, and place it on a concrete floor. The resulting complex metal alloy is an expanded sense: a mixture of atoms that share enough properties to allow them to be brought together but that generate others that are unpredictable and normatively unintelligible.<br><br>Finally, insert it into a space (a.k.a.: light, heat, moisture, architecture, politics) and show it to an audience (a.k.a.: bodies, subjectivities, ideologies), which will trigger yet another series of potential transformations. By the end, that piece of electrical conduit will have crossed so many microscopic and macroscopic boundaries that it’s difficult to determine what it means to even call it a piece of electrical conduit in the first place.<br><br>Mooney calls this piece <i>Collinear Flute</i> (2015) and imagines it as the abstract and entangled offspring of an instrument and a tool. It appears alongside a range of other sculptures and architectural interventions. <i>Taxis Commons</i> (2015) inserts itself within the exhibition’s lighting fixtures: steel wire and plated bits of organic compounds are discreetly wrapped around fluorescent tubes, like organisms feeding off the stimulus of artificial light. Resembling fragile tentacles spreading outwards, <i>Circadian Tackle</i> (2015) and <i>Circadian Tackle II</i> (2015) are made of a series of steel cables and binding wire looped around silver-plated keychains, with fragments of organic compound casts and liver of sulfur, a material used by metalworkers to create patina. Parts of keys reappear elsewhere in <i>Circadian Tackle III</i> (2015), a disassembled electromagnetic lock, and in <i>Architecture for Those of the Mud and of the Sky</i> (2015), a high-performance pet door the artist has inset into a gallery wall and covered with a metal panel, with a silver-plated key fragment emerging from its lock.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02897.jpg\'><br><br>Tying many of these seemingly disparate elements is a materialization of entrance- and exit-points — different types of contact zones and throughways between materials. Keys, locks, and doors are the most literal examples, but the same logic applies to the abstract ways different compounds move in and out of objects and architectural spaces. The works on view are here and elsewhere at the same time, their location not tied to a fixed position.<br><br>“Abstractions,” the philosopher Donna Haraway tells us, “are built in order to be able to break down so that richer and more responsive invention, speculation, and proposing — worlding — can go on.” Mooney feeds and cares for abstractions, while making sure all of them stay in a suspended state and are fragile enough to dissolve.<br><br>These artworks are small, slow, and spread out. They are installed either below our knees or above our heads, and they organize the bodies of their viewers the way a mug organizes a hand. But more than anything, these artworks are like sleeper cells: dormant but always alert in their capacity to act.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02898.jpg\'><br><br>K.r.m.

Accessing the violence Judith Butler and others speak of at the core of the cultural enforcement of gender, the artist Karl Amboy has made an infamous career by spoofing and embodying the male-ist fanaticism of Western American culture. He’s gotten incredibly rich in the process. But the artist has retreated into silence long ago, into the creation of a perfectly real western horror movie town, Amboy, out in the desert.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02936.jpg\'><br><i>“AMBOY/ in out /AMGIRL. . .”</i><br><br>Our filmmaker, German artist “Susan Lichtenstein,” is making a film about Lydia van Vogt, German emigrant and widow of science fiction grandmaster A.E. van Vogt, when she’s interrupted to make the first documentary about Amboy.<br><br>She’s heard of Amboy. At age 19 in the ’80s our filmmaker once published a short text in an art magazine where she herself had naively pointed to Amboy as a feminist.<br><br>She has not heard of the town. It’s an incredibly secreted place, famously without any law, a symbol of art’s removal from ordinary reality and laws. Was this the reason she was selected to make the film? As the film is being made, so it immediately seems, Susan glimpses a movie beyond the horror picture Amboy clearly intends her to make: where gender is itself a projection from outside onto the skin of the real and where the artist craves her/his transformation into a woman.<br><br>Meanwhile, back in Los Angeles, the serial killing of female artists has begun . . . .<br><br>*<br><br>1.

To guarantee the stability of any system, therefore, means to follow one basic formula: <i>minimize friction and maximize flow</i>.<br><br>The same can be said of information itself. Contemporary capitalism rewards those who quickly adapt to any new obstacle, so what matters is to stay fluid and to stay flexible. To do that, the many types of machines that populate our vast infrastructure of computer networks and communication systems need to stay cool. The enemy, for all of them, is not a skilled hacker or a crafty virus — it’s heat.<br><br>Sam Lewitt sides with the enemy. His work adds weight and materiality to systems that would otherwise prefer to run smoothly and invisibly.

What used to require entire buildings now fits on a flat circuit board in your shirt pocket, and people aren’t buying objects but buying subscriptions to services — “it’s more flexible that way.” Everything you need to handle your banking, traveling, exercising, entertaining, communicating, translating, and cooking seems to weigh however much your smart phone weighs — but in fact involves a matrix of energy standards, physical installations, thermal regulation, and thousands of acres of heavily guarded server farms.<br><br>Lewitt’s work turns fluidity into something a bit more viscous, sticky, corroded, and harder to run through the pipes. He muddies the waters of smooth circuitry in order to make visible that which lubricates it. By now, you’ll have noticed that the gallery is a bit darker than it should be and perhaps a bit warmer than it should be.<br><br>The artist has redirected the building’s energy use from light to heat. On the ground are flexible heating circuits Lewitt has had fabricated, which are much larger versions of Kapton/copper composite heaters that are used to maintain and regulate highly targeted temperatures inside communication devices and flexible enough to be installed around irregular shapes and contours. The objects draw their power from long cords coming down from the gallery’s lighting track. The electricity usually used by light bulbs now runs into the sculptures and along the lines etched into their surfaces, generating heat.<br><br>Every morning we come in and turn on the lights, but all we get is heat.<br><br>In reality, nothing about the building has been changed: it circulates and consumes electricity the same way it always has. Lewitt understands that he cannot work against his site nor can he break free from it. He has therefore not altered or broken anything within its structure. The conditions encoded into its materials and capacities are left as they are. He has only added a physical detour to its circuitry, and instead of lighting the gallery, the electricity heats it. In fact, he’s made lighting it impossible, since he designed the heaters to use up the entire capacity of our electrical circuits.<br><br>Being an exhibition space, this change is a significant one, since we rely on light to <i>make visible</i> what we put on display. Our very function as an art space (and any cultural capital that comes from it) depends on this simple, physical, technological, and economic act.<br><br>Lewitt makes that function more difficult for us to perform, which paradoxically makes it easier for us (and our visitors) to recognize. By integrating heating circuits into the building’s existing and available mechanisms, he has made our own physical and ideological standards of operation more sensible. He has made the abstraction of infrastructure warm to the touch.<br><br>As hyper-efficient thermal regulators, these heaters should be able to adapt to any obstacle. So Lewitt puts the resilience of the objects’ properties to the test by presenting the heaters with a different set of conditions: the circuits must now replace something they weren’t meant to replace (lights) and must heat up an area that is larger than they were meant to heat (an open-air exhibition space instead of a vacuum- sealed portable enclosure).<br><br>The results of the stress test? Well, with so many variables crowding the channels, even these ultra- thin flexible circuits just aren’t flexible enough. They do what they can, but there is simply too much empty space around them, too many people walking by, and too much sunlight coming in. The electronic readers attached to each object reveal their internal instabilities and tell a story of precision and calculation contending with inefficiency and waste. In the end, the heaters are left functional but without a function.<br><br>“It is a contradiction of capital that it hates waste, yet produces an unprecedented amount of it.” (Lewitt)<br><br><img src=\'/media/02899.jpg\'><br><br>It might be capitalism’s utopian ambition that it perfects a state of lossless homeostasis — like a thermostat. It might also be its real function to engineer crises and disruptions within its own mechanisms to ensure that its basic organizing principles remain stable. In either case, a world of self-regulating systems that are fully self- correcting and endlessly productive will only ever be a dream. Entropy will inevitably set in, steady states will slip, and energy will be wasted.<br><br>Although we live in a time when businesses advertise how well they manage logistics more than how well they handle machinery, and when power isn’t about muscle but about access to information and control over how it moves around, it’s also true that any infrastructure requires not just mobility but also stability — we need a bit of the former to stay relevant and a bit of the latter to stay reliable. We need fluid management but also a committed workforce. We need responsive software but also solid hardware. We need dynamic subjectivities but also stable materials. Friction is produced in the in-between.<br><br>“Artists,” Lewitt once wrote, “try to capture materials as they flow through the system: paint, plastic, printers, software, hammers, cameras, gestures, jpegs, words, lists, whatever.”<br><br>In this exhibition, the material components of the distribution channels themselves are captured by the thickening of their graphic and plastic characteristics. The etched lines on the copper wall pieces were generated by an optimization algorithm that measured the most efficient path for lines to be traced around a series of words — phrases lifted from that very utopia of perfect balance and self-regulation: <i>belong anywhere, flexible control, get connected, custom profiling</i>. Some of the heaters are draped over old car engines in yet another confrontation between (and misuse of) thermodynamic machines.<br><br>A thermal camera records everything and provides visual documentation of the exhibition at wattis.org. It tracks and renders heat information rather than light (as would be the case for photography or video). In its online version (which for many will be the only version), this exhibition makes visible only its heat: it looks like a series of bright abstract shapes with faint body- like forms occasionally moving around them.<br><br>Let’s see what happens next. As a further test to their flexibility, the heaters will travel from the Wattis Institute in San Francisco to a rented apartment in New York and finally to the Kunsthalle Basel in Switzerland. The objects will therefore navigate a range of parameters, each with its own electrical, physical, ideological, and socio-political characteristics: a college-affiliated American art institution (running on 120V), a private residence (open only by appointment), and a European kunsthalle (running on 220V).<br><br>Any student of art history will want to evoke an installation that seems related: Michael Asher’s 1992 intervention at Kunsthalle Bern, where the artist dramatically altered the space by moving every heater in the building to the foyer. Unlike Asher’s, however, Lewitt’s project isn’t “site-specific” because it isn’t shaped by its sites, but plugs into and determines them — it intervenes at the level of logistics.<br><br>What’s at stake for Lewitt is to understand what art can do within a logic that demands continual adaptation — <i>art in the age of turbocapitalism</i>. His installation makes a few things clear: artworks can’t stop it, they can’t exist outside of it, and they certainly can’t cause it to come crashing down. However, they can insert themselves within its gears and make it less efficient. They can cross wires, add detours, choke engines, steer its energy toward inappropriate ends, and demand that it work against itself. Art can create a logistics that runs against logistics.<br><br>Sam Lewitt (b. 1981, Los Angeles) lives and works in New York. His work has been included in many significant exhibitions in recent years, such as <i>nature after nature</i> at the Fridericianum in Kassel, Germany (2014), and the 2012 Whitney Biennial. With Richard Birkett, he curated the exhibition<i>and Materials and Money and Crisis</i> at MUMOK in Vienna (2013). He has also presented several solo shows at Miguel Abreu Gallery in New York (2014, 2011, 2008, 2006) and Galerie Buchholz in Berlin and Cologne (2013, 2011, 2008). Lewitt received a BFA from the School of Visual Arts and attended the Whitney Independent Study Program in New York.<br><br><i>Sam Lewitt: More Heat Than Light</i> is on view at CCAWattis Institute for Contemporary Arts, in San Francisco, from September 10 to November 21, 2015.

Cantor aimed to contest the secular neutrality of the exhibition environment through the sincere personal disclosures that drive much of her work, often appropriating familiar imagery from cinema that became, in Cantor’s hands, loaded with volatile and excessive emotional force. Ready-made materials are combined with diaristic notes and sketches to probe her perceptions and experiences of personal desire and institutional violence. In her drawings, paintings, collages, and videos, she lifted from iconic films, reorienting the ideological transmissions of the source material. Fictional figures from Disney cartoons, cult horror films, New Wave cinema, and family movies provide a visual foil to her intimate narratives. Magnetized by the doleful naivety of characters such as Snow White and Bambi, Cantor would, in her drawings, extend their narrative horizons to include vivid sexual encounters and crisis-ridden relationships.<br><br><i>My perversion is the belief in true love</i>  is the title Cantor gave to the only survey exhibition of her videos held in her lifetime.<sup>1</sup>This title, framed as an address from the artist herself, introduces a sincere admission of being victim to romantic idealism but also can be understood as an affront to the structural “perversions” of normative desires. This discordant gap between personal experience and political conviction becomes rich terrain for Cantor, whose work always proceeds with a certain force of will: explicitly feminist, remorselessly emotional, dramatic in tone, and, as she herself liked to put it, <a href=\"\">adult in subject matter</a>.<sup>2</sup><br><br><img src=\'/media/02900.jpg\'><br><br>Just as the saccharine ambivalence of the title <i>Cinderella Syndrome</i> suggests, this exhibition emphasizes the constant duality inherent in Cantor’s approach: her commitment to the meeting point of seemingly impossible extremes. <i>Within Heaven and Hell</i> (1996) incorporates footage from Tobe Hooper’s 1974 slasher film <i>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i> and Robert Wise’s 1965 musical drama <i>The Sound of Music</i>. The voiceover is provided by the artist herself recalling a past love, her story spiraling from erotic abandon into dysfunction and pain. Scenes of family bliss in the von Trapp household amid Nazi rule are spliced with the notoriously graphic portrayals of serial killer Ed Gein’s revenge upon the nuclear family. These dissonant depictions are skillfully equated in the editorial rhythm imposed by Cantor, whose approach to montage relies on the regular interruption of an empty black frame, as much as the blurring of materials through double exposure and superimposition.<br><br>In her essay <i>Remember the 14 Days and Nights</i>, Cantor quotes <i>The Stream of Life</i> by Clarice Lispector: \"I refuse to become sad. Let’s be happy. If you’re not afraid of being happy, or just once trying this mad, profound happiness, you’ll have the best of truth.\"<sup>3</sup> A sense of this wild and insistent affirmation is deployed in <i>Evokation of my Demon Sister</i> (2002), the only video in this exhibition in which Cantor’s own voice or body is not present. Using material from Brian de Palma’s Carrie (1976), the work zooms in on the moment when the shy and friendless 17-year-old protagonist is humiliated, explodes in rage, and finds herself capable of exercising havoc through telekinetic powers. Cantor considered <i>Evokation of my Demon Sister</i> a tribute to Kali, the Hindu goddess of destruction. It is said of Kali’s total and transcendental nature, just as all colors disappear in black, so all names and forms disappear in her.<sup>4</sup> Cantor re-situates the female hysteric — a figure that is so often constructed to perpetuate the misogynistic dismissal of female experience — as the harbinger of absolution, a destructive equalizer whose unchecked emotions could signal radical and permanent disavowal of the existing order of things.<br><br>In the final eight years of her life Cantor worked on the feature-length film <i>Pinochet Porn</i>. The film originated in a suite of over 80 drawings named <i>Circus Lives from Hell</i> (2005), which subsequently developed into a storyboard for <i>Pinochet Porn</i>, an episodic narrative about five children growing up under the regime of General Augusto Pinochet in Chile. In <i>Circus Lives from Hell</i>, each child becomes a container for their distinct and multifaceted experiences of dictatorship, from the privileged indulgence of Pinochet’s (fictional) identical twin daughters to a young boy who is orphaned when his mother becomes a victim of the military junta. History is observed through Cantor’s fictive speculations on private experience within a totalizing political order. The story ends with a question: <i>Is tragedy a choice?</i><br><br>Shot on 16 mm film and featuring a complex narrative structure, <i>Pinochet Porn</i>remains an unfinished and ongoing project. This hugely ambitious feature-length work currently remains in postproduction, overseen by an editing team appointed by Cantor before her death. The film features a cast and crew of Cantor’s closest friends, a deliberate decision that provoked startlingly intimate forms of collaboration. In <i>Circus Lives from Hell</i>, Cantor seems to conflate the traumas of childhood with those of adulthood; relations that extend from the largest historical catastrophes, to the most personal misfortunes. <sup>5</sup> <i>Pinochet Porn</i> ultimately came to tell an additional story, that of its own construction, in which the close contact between Cantor and her collaborators extends far beyond the frame of the film.<br><br>\"Keep your mind in hell, and despair not\"<sup>6</sup> is the opening line of Gillian Rose’s posthumously published book <i>Love’s Work</i> (1995). Rose’s memoir, written as she was dying of cancer, uses “love” and “life” almost interchangeably, with an exuberance and melancholy that insistently loops back to the proposition of the book’s opening sentence. There is a resemblance here to Cantor’s own methods, in which films become surrogates for memories, and rapidly rendered drawings are imbued with an almost mystical potential and appear, at times, to resemble astrological charts or Kabbalistic diagrams. Unabashed in subject and passionate, even violent, in its execution, Cantor’s work takes place in the shadows of the historical recitals usually provided by academic or journalistic practices. Mortality is acknowledged, sexual urges are awakened, and private confidences are compelled into dialogue with the structures of imperialism that surround artistic expression.<br><br>Cantor’s approach is distinctive for its emboldened vulnerability and its libidinal critique of the repressed forms of exchange that define the art world and, more broadly, emotional life under late capitalism. She pursued, unapologetically and without irony, an artistic transmission that would intensify relations between author and viewer into a heightened bond that might equally be formed through arousal, repulsion, and critical engagement.<br><br><img src=\'/media/02901.jpg\'><br><br>Pinochet Porn <i>in Progress</i> <br>Ellen Cantor<br><br>Walking through Tenerife wearing a hand-drawn clown mask, nearly mad from grief, I realized I could no longer safely draw on love for inspiration. For seven years he had been my muse, now I had to rethink my entire art practice.<br><br>I tried to think what else interested me enough to engulf my life — perhaps my friendships. I was thinking a lot about my friend Deborah Drier, an exquisite writer, editor, fashion diva; she had just had a double lung transplant and open-heart surgery. I was wondering what aspects of our lives are free choice. Is tragedy a choice? What was her childhood like, a girl genius born in Queens 1948?<br><br>I thought about how the traumas in our childhood brought out parallel traumas in our adulthood, which seemed to extend from the largest historical catastrophes, to the most intimate personal misfortunes. And I realized how little I know about my friends, their childhood and family history, just a bit from confidences, stories, gossip, but not much really.<br><br>I began to make a series of drawings that drew on my best friend who had grown up in South America; she had an extraordinary life. I found I could channel my own raw emotions through her dramas. These drawings <i>Circus Lives from Hell</i> tell an epic story of five kids growing up during the Pinochet regime, and their subsequent adulthood. Each child has experienced the dictatorship completely differently, from the dictator’s identical daughters, Paloma and Pipa, who grow up like princesses and marry the same man, to Jaime who is sent as a child into exile when his mother “disappears.” She was imprisoned, tortured, in the end went mad. It is a soap opera — tragic, comedic, fictionalised and historical. The drawings with their specific stories and dialogue were meant to be a film script, although I was never quite sure how this film could be made.<br><br>Last summer I made an exhibition at Participant Inc in New York, the main work being this drawing script. The director, Lia Gangitano, and I had the idea we would begin creating a film during the show with the help of some of the filmmakers in the gallery, projecting the footage under the drawings as we progressed. My brother, who works in banking, thought this plan was ridiculous, and tried to prepare me for its utter failure. He said that no one was going to devote their time and skill to someone else’s work if they were not getting paid — to get real!<br><br>This really riled John Brattin, an artist-filmmaker working in Super 8 who I really admired (<i>Eros is Sick</i>, 2008, <i>The Triumph of the Night</i>, 2006). He became adamant that we would make this film happen – and from his past experience he started teaching me how to organise the shoots. He took on the huge job as lighting and cameraman. A filmmaker I had never met, Elizabeth Subrin, loaned me her lighting kit. Then Lia and I ran into Jay Kinney on Houston in the pouring rain. He said he would be our art director. He took me to his madhouse on Bleecker Street, showed me his props (tarantula, scorpions, alligator, human skull, bibles, crosses, toy soldiers, etc), told us we could use his flat for sets, and offered up his neighbour’s apartment, baby, and bar.<br><br>The intention was to film some sequences to make a trailer, shooting directly from my drawings. We started with the scene showing the dictator who always fucks his maids, his wife perpetually crying, and the children hysterical. A butch lesbian and her femme girlfriend were going to be the dictator and the maid. But they blew us off. Two friends, Nicola and Laurie, said they would love to do it, but Nicola got busy; then Urs was to be the dictator, but he didn’t answer his phone; Timor suggested prostitutes from the Chelsea hotel, but my work is not about the sex industry. I thought to play the dictator and the maid myself, gender bending. Everyone on the crew hated that idea. Then they thought of Jim Fletcher, a famous New York actor who had been the child murderer in John’s film <i>The Triumph of the Night</i>. I had also seen him play a cannibal in a theatre production at Participant. More than the rest of us, he liked to prepare his lines to get into character. It was completely embarrassing when I had to call him long distance and tell him that his three lines were <a href=\"\">keep dusting bitch</a>, <a href=\"\">bend over you little slut</a> and <a href=\"\">suck it harder</a>! Describing the scene, I told him it could be played real or fake, and asked him if he could choose someone to be the maid.<br><br>Jim didn’t find a maid. So in the end, I said I would do it. I had already been the maid in another scene. And it was getting tiresome trying to convince other people to take their clothes off. The plan was since I’m not an actress I would follow his lead. Coming into the kitchen after a camera break, Jay and Jim had found my wooden spatula and invented a kind of porno scene — this spatula was a present from my ex-boyfriend. My mother had given me a fancy Calphalon pan and he bought a wooden spatula as a symbol of our future domesticity. Unfortunately, that did not last too long and was utterly dire. At last I understood the meaning that revenge is best served on a cold platter!<br><br>Going back to our first shoot where the dictator and maid didn’t show, rather than lose the night, John’s boyfriend Andy went into my closet and came out “the aggrieved wife.” Lia reluctantly agreed to become the hysterical child. She was concerned about her professional relationship to the art world, but she said she would be in this shoot if we didn’t show her face. However when we started to shoot, John kept saying, \"I can’t see your face, can you look this way.\" We set up the scene like Garcia Lorca’s play <i>La Casa De Bernarda Alba</i>. Both Andy and Lia were really crying. Andy’s father had just gotten ill, and Lia was working at PSl, so they both had real reasons to cry. I could see Lia was amazing. I was very apprehensive through the week about how to ask her to be in the next shoot—the identical twin sisters who have grown up to be teenage bitches torturing their maid and boyfriends — surprisingly Lia agreed to come. She showed up with 10 sets of lingerie and high heel outfits, arranging them on my bed. She had picked her clothes from looking at my drawings carefully. Then I knew we had a movie, she was in — she is the star. John, who has known her for 20 or more years, loves filming her. She plays herself and her identical sister.<br><br>Paloma and her six husbands — Lia chose filmmaker Michel Auder to be her first husband, “the older man. . . he was rich but boring.” I imagined him to be fat and unattractive, but Michel is dashing. He marries Paloma, then Pipa, wearing the suit he married Cindy Sherman in. Naked, he is covered with sexy jewelry, going down on Paloma. During the bedroom shoot his openness made me realize how uneasy my generation is about our bodies.<br><br>After failing at stalking Leo Fitzpatrick from <i>Kids</i>, the artist Spencer Sweeney was Lia’s perfect second choice for her second husband, “the young man.” They run away to a deserted island (Robert Moses State Park). At the beach they danced together for one hour without music. It was beautiful to watch.<br><br>John Thompson wanted to be the third husband because he looks similar to the drawing — he’s so tall. He is trained as a professional actor. He stayed in character, “the famous artist,” lecturing Lia about why Hermes window displays weren’t true conceptual art, patronisingly asking her if she was learning anything new?<br><br>Harri Kupiainen is perfect as the fifth husband, Guillermo the rock star. He broke his guitar for us! And Paloma and Guillermo really seem in love.<br><br>Jay picked Danny McDonald to be the sixth husband. Mainly he plays a comic role (a dummy-sucking masochist from Queens), but it was quite moving to see him become the grief-stricken fireman.<br><br>It transpires that Danny is actually from a family lineage of firemen — his father and grandfather. He became an artist. I was standing on Lafayette Street, lost, looking for the fireman store that wasn’t there. At that exact moment Jay texted me the store’s new address; it had apparently moved. Uncannily, he didn’t know I was going shopping for a fireman’s uniform. It was touching how synchronistic we had become in the making of this film. This is what is most satisfying about the making of <i>Pinochet Porn</i>— the magical intuitive cooperation, especially as being an artist can often be extremely solitary. Essentially this film is a collaboration of friends; it is possible to shoot only with the contribution of each person involved.<br><br>Back in London, through a moment of divine (drunken) inspiration, Pablo León de la Barra has become the Spanish narrator.<br><br>This summer we will begin to shoot the first chapter in London: the story of Manuelo, the clown boy, who becomes enlightened but still bites his fingernails. This takes place in an ashram in which Cerith Wyn Evans plays Osha, the fucking guru, he taught his disciples about free love with no jealousy. . .<br><br><i>Originally published in MAP magazine, Issue 19, August 2009</i><br><br>NOTES <br>(1) Kunstahalle Wien, Vienna, 1998, curated by Gerald Matt<br>(2) Interview with Hartmut Austen, DETROIT, 2008<br>(3) Ellen Cantor, <i>Remember the 14 Days and Nights</i>, 1997, p 5<br>(4) <i>Mahanirvana Tantra</i>, Sir John Woodroffe, 2007<br>(5) Ellen Cantor, “<i>Pinochet Porn</i> in Progress”, MAP magazine, Issue 19, August 2009<br>(6) Gillian Rose, <i>Love’s Work: A Reckoning with Life</i>, 1995, p. 1<br><br><br><i>Ellen Cantor: Cinderella Syndrome</i> is co-curated by Jamie Stevens and Fatima Hellberg and is made possible by Kulturstiftung des Bundes.

Some parts are painted, some are bagged, some stand straight, and others are perched up high. A network of metal rods holds them together, forming a central nervous system that allows each painting, sculpture, or piece of architecture to function as a dispersed limb of a single organism. As such, they belong with and fold into each other. Objects migrate into paintings, and bodies find a way to slip into objects. The flat surfaces of walls soften and take on the properties of fleshy skin or upholstered furniture, and cling to the paintings that hang on or inside them. The thin lines that cut through the space reappear on 19th-century portraits in the form of prostheses, and wooden sculptures cut from table legs contain that same sense of distortion.<br><br>Each element depends on another—<i>the way a hand depends on a wrist</i>—and it seems entirely possible that any change made to a painting would alter the shape of a sculpture or the angle of a wall on the other side of the room.<br><br>In many ways, this is what the future looks like—a cybernetic entanglement where bodies merge with matter and space has a consciousness of its own.<br><br>Until fairly recently, bodies and objects have been easy to tell apart. People put objects on their bodies and put their bodies on objects all the time, and they don’t usually lose their ability to distinguish between the two—<i>no one mistakes the neck for the necklace</i>, and everyone knows which is the finger and which is the phone. There has been a basic understanding of where the body begins and where it ends.<br><br>The history of technology, for some, is a story about the body and its dependency on artificial forms. Used to enhance (and at times to replace) the body, objects have helped develop a more efficient and productive body, one capable of overcoming its vulnerabilities.<br><br>But in writing about the prosthetic or the post-human, theorists such as Elizabeth Grosz or N. Katherine Hayles point to how a technological apparatus can never entirely consume, capture, compute, or replace the tone of a voice, the character of a gesture, the rhythm of a laugh, the discretion of a pose, or the temperament of a glimpse. The body is still an affected body, an infected body, a contingent body... a body always vulnerable to itself.<br><br>Knowledge and consciousness, they argue, are always embodied, always enmeshed within the specifics of the body’s relationship to space, time, form, and culture.<br><br>Grosz therefore sees promise in any art or science that “presents us with the possibilities of bodies that are <i>barely conceivable</i>, that challenge and problematize the very stability and givenness of bodies, that force us to rethink our presumptions and our understandings of what bodies are.”<br><br><a href=\"\">Markus Schinwald</a> imagines new, other, and sometimes impossible types of bodies and ways of thinking about bodies. His paintings, sculptures, videos, performances, and installations confuse the boundaries between bodies, objects, spaces, and behaviors, and complicate the norms that govern the ways we understand how they all coexist.<br><br>“I’m not trying to rob people of their personalities, but to give objects personalities, too.”<br><br><img src=\'/media/02910.jpg\'><br><br>Schinwald’s works have good moods, bad moods, nervous tics, and psychological baggage. They have “issues” in the way most relationships do. Conversely, the artist also imagines a world where a state of mind could give rise to an object. “What if,” the work asks, “a moment of anxiety could generate a neck brace?”<br><br>In its most basic form, the prosthesis is a technology that joins two disparate parts to create something new.When inscribed within the norms and conventions of human progress, the prosthesis exists to correct a fault, fulfill a void, and make an impossible body <i>possible</i> again. But when freed from those norms, the prosthesis is able to make a body impossible again.<br><br>Buying minor 19th-century portraits at auction, Schinwald carefully alters the images by adding incoherent characteristics such as surgical masks, straightjackets, neck braces, nose piercings, or even orthodontic apparatuses. These new details manipulate as much as they decorate. The types of portraits he purchases proliferated during the Biedermeier era (1815–48), when restrictive political policies and censorship resulted in conservative paintings of poised figures in buttoned-up shirts and flawless hairdos. Schinwald intervenes by adding possible defects, and imagines how the sitter’s interior mental state might manifest itself in the form of an artificial prosthesis, albeit one with a purpose that remains unclear. One can only presume that should the figure’s mood change, or a sudden moment of panic or joy emerge, the prosthesis might disappear or readjust. In other words, the object is not a defect at all.<br><br>Similarly, Schinwald’s sculptures of wooden table legs inject the properties of life into inanimate objects. Sawed off from Chippendale-style tables, the sculptures are placed around the room as if an object’s erratic movements had been captured in a series of frozen moments... Uninhibited by their objecthood, they are instilled with a heightened sense of agency and, as such, become deviant objects—they <i>bend</i>, they <i>stretch</i>, they <i>crawl</i>, they <i>itch</i>, they <i>flirt</i>. Some even wrap themselves around bronze poles and s p r e a d their legs.<br><br>The mechanism that holds the paintings and sculptures together is the room itself. Schinwald establishes an <i>architecture of dependency</i> among padded walls, brass rods, wooden legs, and painted faces, with each part of this network unfolding through the space like a dismembered limb or an artificial joint.<br><br>It seems counterintuitive that something that constrains or distorts a body can be what a body wants or needs. But Schinwald’s work is less about celebrating fetishistic dysfunction than it is about challenging the ways we think about the nature of dysfunction itself. Inserting impediments not only disrupts the natural tendency to correct, replace, or repair, but also imagines a state where concealing a problem is more dysfunctional than putting it on display.<br><br>This would be a world where knees happily <i>twitch</i> whenever they come close to their favorite doorknob, and where metal objects experience the same moments of despair or excitement as the rest of us.<br><br>In his 1962 novel <i>The Ticket That Exploded</i>, William S. Burroughs imagines that the human body contains within it a set of “pre-recordings” that behave like parasites, always ready to take over. “Carry Corders of the world unite. You have nothing to lose but your pre-recordings.”<br><br>The only way to fight back is to record the pre-recordings and then cut them up, displace them, play them against each other, and allow the ensuing <i>distortions and hallucinations</i> to produce another world.<br><br>Schinwald, like Burroughs, does what good science fiction does: He formulates a critique of preexisting norms and laws, devises ways to short-circuit them, and proposes other possible (or impossible) alignments and alliances between bodies, objects, emotions, and spaces... His is a future where inefficiency and dysfunction are not only normal, but entirely efficient and functional.<br><br>*<br><br>Markus Schinwald (b. 1973, Salzburg, Austria) lives in Vienna and New York. Recent solo exhibitions include CAPC Musée d’Art Contemporain, Bordeaux (2013), Kunstverein Hannover (2011), Kunsthaus Bregenz (2009), and the Migros Museum, Zurich (2008). He represented Austria in the 2011 Venice Biennale. A solo show opens at the M – Museum Leuven later this year.

Originally delivered as a lecture at the Wattis Institute, Andrew Durbin\'s text takes the form of a personal essay, expertly weaving anecdotes of his own encounters with Bellamy\'s writing with insights into broader themes in her work. Prof. Kaye Mitchell takes a close look at the role of shame and its relationship to femininity in particular texts by Bellamy. And Bellamy and her late husband Kevin Killian offer deeply personal, emotionally wrenching ruminations on topics from the mundane (drawing) to the profound (mortality).

Drawing on both the poetics and politics of revision, the project gathers inspiration from annotations, paratext, and pretext; Rasheed’s recollections of her father’s notes which include cut up and annotated religious texts; Black vernacular typography; her growing collection of Black printed matter; and autocorrect algorithms. <br><br>For Rasheed, texts are part of an ecosystem that is in constant flux, operating with intertextual and interdependent relationships. In this spirit, the project emphasizes process and open participation, unfolding as a collection of workbooks, in-progress essays and writing, half-formed ideas, and research notes—forms Rasheed refers to as “leaky and wet.” The project culminates in a publication with the remnants of our engagement and an essay in progress. <br><br><a href = \'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XHyeqpTr1op4tsyiOwv-yoApume9OY59/view?usp=sharing\' target= \'new\'>Click here</a> to download the first workbook.<br><br>This project is the third iteration of Rasheed’s ongoing work <i>Scoring the Stacks</i>, previously presented at the Brooklyn Public Library and Haverford College.<br><br><a href=\"https://nomegallery.com/artists/kameelah-janan-rasheed/\">Kameelah Janan Rasheed</a> is a Brooklyn-based learner from East Palo Alto, CA.

A vital contributor to the Bay Area\'s avant-garde literary scene, Bellamy is a novelist and poet whose work has focused on sexuality, politics, feminism, narrative experimentation, and all things queer. In her words, she champions “the vulnerable, the fractured, the disenfranchised, the fucked-up.”<br><br><i>Dodie Bellamy Is on Our Mind</i> is the first major publication to address Bellamy\'s prolific career as a genre-bending writer. Megan Milks made several trips to San Francisco in order to spend time with Bellamy and craft a provocative and fascinating profile of the writer. Originally delivered as a lecture at the Wattis Institute, Andrew Durbin\'s text takes the form of a personal essay, expertly weaving anecdotes of his own encounters with Bellamy\'s writing with insights into broader themes in her work. Academic Kaye Mitchell takes a close look at the role of shame and its relationship to femininity in particular texts by Bellamy. And Bellamy and her late husband Kevin Killian offer deeply personal, emotionally wrenching ruminations on topics from the mundane (drawing) to the profound (mortality). These texts, alongside archival photos and a complete bibliography make, this book an important compendium on Bellamy.',''),(1014,1,'2020-02-19 03:55:39','2020-03-24 20:38:59',3800,'A conversation with Lydia Ourahmane and Anthony Huberman ',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'a-conversation-with-lydia-ourahmane-and-anthony-huberman',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',_binary 'On the occasion of <a href= \"/gallery/lydia-ourahmane-%C3%B8%C2%B5%C3%B8-%C3%B8-%C3%B8-%C3%B8-u-%C3%B8%C2%B3us%C3%B8-solar-cry-2020\">Lydia Ourahmane</a>\'s first institutional solo exhibition in the US, the artist speaks with Wattis Director and Chief Curator Anthony Huberman.<br><br><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"20\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/762839362&color=%23ff0000&inverse=false&auto_play=false&show_user=true\"></iframe><br><br>Lydia Ourahmane\'s <a href= \"/gallery/lydia-ourahmane-%C3%B8%C2%B5%C3%B8-%C3%B8-%C3%B8-%C3%B8-u-%C3%B8%C2%B3us%C3%B8-solar-cry-2020\">solo exhibition</a> took place in 2020.

It will be launched publicly soon, but as Curator\'s Forum members, you get a <span style=\"color:#ff0000\">sneak peek</span> <a href=\"https://www.wattis.org/library\">here</a>.

For instance, people often ask me <span style=\"color:#ff0000\">if I read art magazines</span>, and the one I find myself reading most regularly is <a href=\"http://4columns.org/\"><i>4Columns</i></a>. Each week, four 1000-word reviews appear in my inbox. They range from exhibition to book to architecture to album reviews, and more. The writing is very good, and regular contributors include Hilton Als, Hannah Black, Catherine Damman, Geeta Dayal, Aruna D\'Souza, Sasha Frere-Jones, Ed Halter, Wayne Koestenbaum, Chris Kraus, Maggie Nelson, Sarah Rifky, and Lynne Tillman, among many others. <br><br>[image3]<br><br>The <span style=\"color:#ff0000\">\"artist talk,\"</span> as a form, can go different ways. There is the straightforward \"here is what my work is about,\" sure, but there are a range of other approaches. One of my favorites is by <span style=\"color:#ff0000\">the late Lutz Bacher</span>. She began a talk, a few years ago, by describing the first talk she ever gave...in kindergarten. <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/158164383/\">Here</a> is the whole thing. <br><br>Another artist who always keeps me on my toes is <span style=\"color:#ff0000\">Pope.L</span>. <a href=\"https://renaissancesociety.org/publishing/259/william-popel-artist-talk/\">Here</a> is one I was lucky enough to attend at the Renaissance Society in Chicago back in 2013. <br><br>I was also happy to catch the inimitable novelist, playwright, critic, and essayist <span style=\"color:#ff0000\">Gary Indiana</span> at SculptureCenter last year, when he was in particularly good form, <a href=\"http://www.sculpture-center.org/materials/12143/sc-conversations-vile-days-with-gary-indiana-and-bruce-hainley\">here</a>. <br><br>[image4]<br><br>Well before the current crisis, some institutions have been thinking about \"virtual\" exhibitions or artworks. In my hometown, the Centre d\'Art Contemporain Genève, in Geneva, has added a <span style=\"color:#ff0000\">5th digital floor</span> to its 4 brick-and-mortar floors, which is where it hosts an online radio channel, lectures, but also new works commissioned for this digital space.

One of the first ones was <span style=\"color:#ff0000\">Ubuweb</span>, which is still going strong and is as eclectic as ever. Click <a href=\"http://www.ubu.com/recent.html\">here</a>, <span style=\"color:#ff0000\">at your own risk</span>, for endless gems, from Agnès Varda films or Mona Hatoum performances to a history of Peruvian sound art. <a href=\"http://www.ubu.com/film/smith-john_girl.html\">Here\'s</a> a personal favorite, John Smith\'s film \"A Girl Chewing Gum.\"<br><br>[image6]<br><br>I\'ve recently been reading and thinking a lot about <span style=\"color:#ff0000\">drumming and percussion</span>. There is an extraordinary drummer and artist, Milford Graves, who I\'ve been able to spend some time with. <span style=\"color:#ff0000\">Wow.

Our sharing of otherwise unshareables makes me think about Hakim Bey’s <i>The Temporary Autonomous Zone</i>. Maybe we do need to keep making little resistances here and there, and change our locations so that authorities cannot catch us. It makes me think about Léonie’s suggestion to listen (for the first time for God’s sake) rather than endlessly talk without even taking any breath — as we usually do in the art world.<br><br>At the library, I was conducting research for my article on Istanbul Queer Art Collective’s piece when I saw a big piece of wooden furniture with too many drawers in the middle of the space. Out of curiosity, I started to open and close each and every drawer. I guess I spent an unnecessarily long time there, as a librarian came to me and asked: Is everything alright? He told me that the furniture was for index cards. <br><br>The librarian opened a random drawer — the drawer which shelters the cards on “GHOST”—of course. The Derridean <i>hauntology</i> keeps coming back to us in strange spaces — the meshing of the past, the present, and the future. How many ghosts do we carry inside? Léonie draws on hundreds-of-years-old paper with pencil. In one of her marble pieces, if you look really carefully, you could see the ghost of a previous drawing: blurry, and out of focus — the periphery, the leftover.<br><br>Apparently, they keep the musical syntax only for their “pretty” furniture. I was sad about the disappearance of the possibility of discovery in the library’s spaces, and the librarian answered me: Do you know the word <i>serendipity</i>?<br><br><br>*<br><br><br>November 28, 2018<br><br>Dear M, <br><br>Today in Steve’s class, we watched a talk by Jimmie Durham. He wrapped himself in some kind of colorful fabric during his talk. It seemed like a small but powerful flaw in the flow of everyday life. Léonie hides three small drawings in the exhibition space. I get super sad when I see visitors leaving the space without noticing them because they are in a rush. But this show is for the ones who can make the time to slow down. Slowing down can be a glitch in a world of rushing. The syndrome of Bartleby, the Scrivener: I prefer not to. But how do we make sure that our voice does not disappear in all of this noise?<br><br><br>*<br><br><br>November 29, 2018<br><br>Dear M,<br><br>Today Julie Lazar visited us for Dena’s class. I listened to her in a weird state of lunacy as she explained to us the “serendipitous nature” of how she got to work with John Cage, for <i>Rolywholyover A Circus for Museum</i> by John Cage at LA MOCA. Cage thought museums were so boring that he decided to have some fun. It was a LIVING space — with Shaker-style cherry-wood seed cabinets, hosting chessboards and books from Cage’s personal library. <br><br>Thinking about all the political turmoil, what is the point of doing any kind of programming at any type of institution nowadays? Are institutions there to complicate things or to create a space for solidarity? It is as if the world solely consists of two extreme binaries. <br><br>The word <i>rolywholyover</i> comes from James Joyce’s <i>Finnegans Wake</i>. In some parts of the book, Joyce does not make any sense in the way that he utilizes the language, and it is on purpose. It is a protest against the hierarchical structures of the language. <br><br>When Léonie refers to her works, she talks about the concept of “pre-language.” It is a world of symbols, body-gestures, and curious shapes. In this world, nobody can overwhelm the other by using language as their weapon — symbols belong to everyone; they are the exact opposite of inequality and inaccessibility. <br><br>Léonie’s works are all about imperfection in a world of perfectionist spectacles. It is apparent in the asymmetrical cutting of the marble that she draws on, or the paper that she uses which carry the memories of their private users in their tired bodies. <br><br>Their silence is a suggestion to take a break and to think about what goes unsaid, to look for the underscored, and to hold eye contact with the one whose voice otherwise goes unheard. Léonie complicates this moment, suggesting a space in which we — the leftovers of the spectacle — can come together to listen to each other’s silence. <br><br>Visiting Léonie’s show is like listening to Cage’s <i>4′33′′</i>.<br><br><br>*<br><br><br>November 30, 2018<br><br>Dear M,<br><br>Today we visited the Legion of Honor and de Young Museums. It was a day of complicated feelings — highlighted with the colonial gestures of collecting those objects from around the world and showcasing them as part of someone’s own narrative; a feeling of questionable superiority, a sudden emotional burnout, learned helplessness. <br><br>Somebody was offended by the mummy showcased at the de Young Museum. I remembered our visit to Museo Egizio in Turin — the excitement. I was not bothered by the presence of the mummy, but I also did not want to sound politically incorrect. Obviously, we do not have the consent of the mummified person to be shown, but at the same time, agreement to mummification carries the implicit understanding that your body could be a spectacle one day. It is a moment of pause in the historical narrative to think about the ones who were here before us, and to be curious about our ancestral memories that we share due just to being citizens of this world despite our generational differences of hundreds of years. <br><br>Léonie uses paper that is ages old to draw her prelinguistic shapes on. She called me the other day almost whispering, and asked me: Did you realize that the paper has been transforming due to the moisture in the space? And we looked closely together, standing there next to each other silently. Léonie put those papers on cardboard in a gentle way, without pushing them out of their unique existence but in line with their needs. <br><br>They have been restlessly lying on that cardboard for the length of the exhibition, but recently decided to fold slowly to go back to their “real” existence — looking for their essence.<br><br>Léonie says, somebody should have put something on this paper almost two hundred years ago, somewhere around India. <br><br>As a result, four pieces of paper have been slowly moving — almost under the threshold of human perception — so that nobody recognizes them and decides to prevent them from finding their true selves. <br><br>Resistance as a utilization of soft power. <br><br>Imperfection as a way of thinking. Finding undercommons.<br><br><br>*<br><br><br>December 1, 2018<br><br>Dear M,<br><br>My landlord Mary — who is almost 70 years old — invited me to her chorus concert at Calvary Presbyterian Church. <br><br>I have been listening to her practicing, sitting here downstairs, as our walls are pretty thin. At the church, when they turned off the lights and started walking around the church with candles in their hands, singing gently, I cried — mourning for a past that never was, and with some kind of obscure nostalgia for a future that never will be — see, this is how <i>hauntology</i> haunts me. <br><br>Léonie showcases Shaker gift drawings as part of her show. These drawings come from meditation sessions of Shaker women in which they contact friendly ghosts — which later turn into various chorus songs. <br><br>Shaker women gift each other the knowledge and the insight that they gain as a result of these dialogues.<br><br>Gift economy as a counteraction.<br><br><br>*<br><br><br>December 2, 2018<br><br>Today nothing interesting happened, at least as far I can remember. Thinking in line with Léonie’s suggested thought experiments — this means that I basically was not paying attention. I was not present, but lost in the problems of yesterday or tomorrow. <br><br>Take a pause, slow down.<br><br><br>*<br><br><br>December 3, 2018<br><br>Dear M, <br><br>Today I sent you a picture of one of Léonie’s works on paper. You told me that it could be a mythological symbol for a phoenix or a ghost. It looked like it dated back to centuries ago, so you suggested that I look into symbols of infinity. You asked me: How would you describe an idea or a memory, making use of only one symbol?<br><br>Here is a word that I have been carrying around: <br><br>su·per·no·va<br>/ˌso͞opərˈnōvə/<br>noun ASTRONOMY <br>a star that suddenly increases greatly in brightness because of a catastrophic explosion that ejects most of its mass.<br><br>In Steve’s class today, one of the students, David, showed me his architectural renderings, and explained how fruits could turn into buildings. <br><br>Léonie works for hours on one single drawing — she collects memories of symbols, window-shopping at museums. Those symbols turn into prelinguistic gestures; dark stains on clean white paper. The outcome and its various possible meanings keep transforming each other reciprocally.<br> <br>Non-sense, on purpose.<br><br><br>*<br><br><br>December 4, 2018<br><br>Dear M, today is Rilke’s birthday. If he was alive, he’d be 143 years old. <br><br>Did you know the story of Jeremy Bentham who mummified himself? <br><br><a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-tuesday-edition-1.4320308/why-philosopher-jeremy-bentham-s-severed-stolen-and-poorly-preserved-head-is-back-on-display-1.4320319\">https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-tuesday-edition-1.4320308/why-philosopher-jeremy-bentham-s-severed-stolen-and-poorly-preserved-head-is-back-on-display-1.4320319</a><br><br>I wonder whether Rilke would like that as well? <br><br>Today, I listened to Steve singing poems from his most recent book at City Lights Bookstore: “She is singing. I get excited when she does that. You would too.”<br><br>I wish Léonie was here.<br><br><br>*<br><br><br>December 5, 2018<br><br>I watched Trinh T. Minh-ha’s <i>Reassemblage</i> at the library today. Her writing makes me excited in the way that she uses the vulnerable and the ambiguous as a methodology. In a world in which everything is rated in terms of its efficiency, inefficiency becomes the counterargument, a tempting possibility in the world of endless combinations. <br><br><i>Reassemblage</i> problematizes the perspective of the ethnographer. Minh-ha acknowledges the subjectivity of the ethnographer and suggests a visual collage instead.<br> <br>I think of Léonie’s works as collages, made of a little bit of silence and some lines.<br><br><br>*<br><br><br>December 6, 2018<br><br>Today, I spent my day looking at Léonie’s works at the Wattis for a superfluously long time. <br><br>What does it mean to open up space for others in the limited spaces that we are given? There is something special about Léonie’s gesture to show Terry Fox’s <i>The Children’s Tapes</i> (1974). It is a series of actions performed for the Foxes’ young son in which objects are used to produce various transformations — \"magic.” <br><br>We are out of words, it is time to invite magic into the institutions. <br><br>Our protest is hidden in our gestures in which we utilize the resources of the system to enlarge strict definitions, to create allies, and to share territories by making silent invitations. <br><br>It is about finding the bugs of the system, and it can be in the form of a candle that burns magically, or as an invitation — if you like to believe in it.<br><br><br>*<br><br><br>December 7, 2018<br><br><i>“seasons invent themselves but we invent the underground”</i><br><br>Dear M, <br><br>I have been thinking a lot about how Tongo Eisen-Martin reads his poems. <br><br>He memorizes them, like Bradbury’s characters from <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> memorize various books. Tongo reads them from his memory on stage, with his eyes shut. And his voice rises in pitch slowly but meticulously. <br><br>It reminds me of Léonie.<br><br>In the end, all I can hear is a silent scream, in which words do not matter anymore.<br>',''),(1039,1,'2020-04-07 22:08:45','2021-02-20 01:19:02',329,'Where are the tiny revolts? \r\n(A Series of Open Questions, vol. 1)\r\n$15 ',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'where-are-the-tiny-revolts-a-series-of-open-questions-vol-1-15',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Where are the tiny revolts? \r\n(A Series of Open Questions, vol. 1)\r\nCCA Wattis Institute and Sternberg Press, 2020\r\nPaperback, 320 pages\r\n\r\nEdited by Jeanne Gerrity and Anthony Huberman.

I was happy to hear back from so many of you, after my last email, and to know that you are doing well. And it seems like several of you enjoyed the list of links I sent around. Most importantly, I hope you continue to be safe and healthy. It\'s such a confusing, tragic, and difficult time. ',_binary '[image1]<br><br>I don\'t know about you, but I\'ve been spending much of the last few weeks looking at screens. And while I\'m certainly grateful for the internet and the many ways we can all remain connected, <span style=\"color:#ff0000\">my most memorable art experiences happen off-line and off-screen</span>. So that\'ll be my theme this time: art-related, but not screen-based.<br><br>[image2] <br><br>We all need to exercise, and one good way to do that is to <span style=\"color:#ff0000\">go for a walk</span>. Fortunately, we live in a city filled with lots of <span style=\"color:#ff0000\">public art</span>. Depending on what neighborhood you live in, works by great artists are just a short walk away, are always on view, and don\'t require standing too close to anyone. <br><br>At Fort Mason, in the Marina, there is <span style=\"color:#ff0000\">Giuseppe Penone\'s</span> <i>La logica del vegetale (The Logic of the Vegetal)</i> and <i>Idee di pietra (Ideas of Stone)</i>. In the first, a bronze cast of a tree, life-sized, lies on its side, while five living saplings grow out of the ground and into the metal branches. And then a second bronze tree stands upright but with immense stones perched high up in its branches. It\'s an impressive sight, and Penone is one of Arte Povera\'s great masters. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Great+Meadow+Park+at+Fort+Mason/@37.8047706,-122.4304005,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x5f831b973bd34679!8m2!3d37.8047706!4d-122.4304005\">Here</a> is where you need to go (and for those unfamiliar with Penone\'s work, <a href=\"https://gagosian.com/quarterly/2020/01/09/video-giuseppe-penone-fort-mason/\">here</a> is a short video with the artist describing it in his own words). <br><br>[image3] <br><br>For those who live downtown, be sure to walk by <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/555+Mission+Street,+San+Francisco,+CA+94105\">555 Mission St</a> to see <span style=\"color:#ff0000\">Ugo Rondinone\'s</span> hilarious <i>Moonrise Sculptures: March, October, December</i>. a trio of aluminum heads that look like something out of <i>Where the Wild Things Are</i> or from the famous cantina scene in <i>Star Wars</i>, only huge. (And Jonathan Borofsky\'s much more colorful <i>Human Sculptures</i> are installed in the same plaza).<br><br>[image4]<br><br>The murals in the Mission are well-known, but if you live in the neighborhood, walk down 26th Street, between Mission and Valencia, and you\'ll come across a tiny alley.

Many of them have particularly good selections of art books and experimental music, and <span style=\"color:#ff0000\">they need your business</span>.

When we closed our galleries due to COVID-19, we asked her to reflect on her experience of Lydia Ourahmane’s exhibition. Rouser created a series of collages in response. She also wrote a short essay reflecting on the show. Read Rouser\'s essay below, interspersed with a selection of her collages.<br><br><br>*<br><br><br>Viewing Lydia Ourahmane’s <i>Solar Cry</i>, I was endlessly moved. An excerpt from the exhibition catalog helped to shape my response: <br><br><br><i>Lydia Ourahmane is interested in how belief is registered on the body, in the ways it is made </i>material<i>. Even if belief is a mental state, she asks, does it also have physical repercussions? How does faith or belief materialize, as it rushes through bodies? Does it leave a mark of where it’s been? And does it linger in empty buildings, like an echo, long after believers have left? What types of human belief systems has that Cyprus tree witnessed? </i>(Anthony Huberman)<br><br><br>The words “material”, “mark”, and “witnessed” in the above passage resonated with my reading of Ourahmane\'s work. As much as it addresses immaterial concepts, <i>Solar Cry</i> is heavily grounded in materiality. The material nature of the exhibition informs and gives voice to the immaterial. <br><br><img src=\'https://www.wattis.org/media/02995.jpg\'><br><br>The materials chosen to present the exhibition are varied and intentional; each object and each mark has its proper place. The presence of three kilograms of salt within the gallery is a marker signifying the price of a son’s life in the slave trade between Algeria and Niger. This combined with the artist’s intention for the “experiencers” of the exhibition to interact with this salt nearly brought me to tears. As the salt is stepped on and subsequently crushed, marks on the floor of the gallery appear. <br><br>Similarly, the gallery is covered with an indigo lens. A tribute to the Tuareg people who inhabit the Tassili N’Ajjer plateau, for me it invokes a tone of peace, of tranquility, and of a contemplative silence.<br><br><img src=\'https://www.wattis.org/media/03000.jpg\'><br><br>This silence is contrasted by the inherently violent act of gallery visitors crushing the salt under the weight of their bodies. We become participants, and further, witnesses of the exhibition by changing its material elements.<br><br>Further, we become passive participants as we listen to the operatic duet in the front room of the gallery. This duet, performed by one mezzo soprano opera singer, involved the singing of the notes A-flat and B-flat for the duration of one hour each. The medium (audio tape) on which these beautiful strains were recorded is intended to degrade over time. <br><br>The voices harmonize and overlap, and waver in their pitches. This voice, or voices, “linger in empty buildings, like an echo, long after believers have left,\" writes Huberman. The tapes run and they degrade whether we listen or not. The witnessing is passive, yet as powerful as the act of crushing the currency required to purchase a life. Remembrance is registered. <br><br>The relationship between silence and materiality intrigued me. What does this relationship look like? How is silence rendered materially? The fecund pauses between the sung A-flat and B-flat notes give weight to silence. Silence takes on a spatial presence and dimension. The silence is rendered in the embedding of eight transducer speakers in the wall separating the front and back galleries. <br><br><img src=\'https://www.wattis.org/media/02998.jpg\'><br><br>The following excerpt from the exhibition catalog was instrumental in shaping my thoughts on <i>silence</i>: <br><br><i>A Solar Cry, then, is one where silence is sovereign. It’s a cry that thickens all the interruptions and the intervals between sounds—the suspended part of the beat that makes the rhythm. It’s the gaps that open up between the grooves. With this exhibition, Ourahmane harvests the space\'s past and present silences, making them ready for visitors to witness. She creates a context where some of those sacred cries might be felt, even for a short moment, and where they can leave traces behind as they pass by.</i> (Huberman)<br><br><br>* <br><br>In response to the exhibition, Rouser created a series of physical collages with newsprint, vellum, computer paper, tracing paper, tagboard, and recycled paper. She tore the paper to reveal its materiality, then scanned each collage and digitally altered it.<br><br><img src=\'https://www.wattis.org/media/02996.jpg\'><br><br>“In making these collages, I wanted to transform the paper, or the canvas, in impactful ways. Once I scanned the images, I realized that I needed to apply a digital lens to the works in order to make the works more cohesive. I wanted to render material both silence and the punctuation of silence by sound in my collages,\" writes Rouser.<br><br>“Paper carries economic, social and political connotations. It can be acquired quickly and for a relatively low cost, it can disseminate crucial information, and it can be torn, crumpled, stapled, bundled, and transformed in ways that may appear violent.”<br><br><br><img src=\'https://www.wattis.org/media/02997.jpg\'><br><br><img src=\'https://www.wattis.org/media/02999.jpg\'><br><br><img src=\'https://www.wattis.org/media/03001.jpg\'><br><br>All images are courtesy of Kelly Rouser.

On March 19, a formal “shelter-in-place” order was issued by the governor of California, and just like that, life as we knew it changed. It is easy to lose track of how many days we have been sheltering in place. We were told this would be over April 7, a date later revised to April 30, and it is almost certain that date will shift again.<br><br><i>The Word for World is Forest</i> was scheduled to open one week from today at the CCA Wattis Institute. The exhibition was to be the culmination and celebration of a year of research, collaboration, and imagination, and the capstone to our final year in the Curatorial Practice Graduate Program. As the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc on the world, it became clear that the show and its opening would not take place as planned. Amidst a flood of emails in our inboxes about cancelled and postponed events, exhibitions, and programs, it is hard to pinpoint whether we received this news before we learned that hundreds of cultural workers were laid off at museums around the world or after. While we are disappointed and heartbroken, mourning the loss of an exhibition in the wake of global crisis feels selfish, untimely, and foolish.<br><br>Along with many facets of life, <i>The Word for World is Forest</i> now exists in an unpredictable state. We are trying to learn how to move forward holding uncertainty. Even the Bay Area weather doesn’t seem to know what to do. Days of sunshine pull us out of our sweatpants to feel the tingle of something on the edges of our skin, followed by grey rainstorms pushing us back inside. We pivot back and forth, between sadness and joy—sadness at the state of affairs and joy found in a plant’s new sprouts, the first hummingbird arriving to a newly built feeder, or a loved one’s call. We try to move forward against an invisible force compelling us to slow down. Sometimes we cave to the tension between forces, and sometimes we push through. Neither is the right answer right now. <br><br>It is important to understand we are also humans after all, with our own existential crises, worried about our families and loved ones, about visas, about our own financial precarity and graduating soon, and about many others. No matter what happens, we keep talking with each other, listening, giving space, trying to understand. We feel grateful for those who support us, artists who stand next to us in this chaos, and the mentors and people who are there for us. <br><br><i>The Word for World is Forest</i> brings up the notion that societal changes can emerge from looking to the past and present. At this moment in time, we are facing multiple ruptures in the fabric that structures how we navigate our day to day lives. Our mission for this exhibition remains and has become all the more timely as the reality of a worldwide crisis sets in. How can we do this world-building from the confines of our isolation?<br><br>Looking to Ursula K. Le Guin, we remember the power of imagination ignited through books and stories. If the pandemic has taught us anything, it is that we need to reimagine the possibilities with what we have available to us and not lose hope because of bleak circumstances. Here, in these pages, lies an exhibition that may never come to physical fruition. At the moment, we cannot install the artworks, paint the wall, nor turn on the lights in the Wattis gallery, but that does not limit our ability to reify the project through our imaginations. Page by page, we will walk you through the selected artists and their works, leave space for some of them to tell their own stories, and invite you to plant your own seeds. <br><br>This catalog proposes many possibilities. We hope you can take some comfort in that.  Sit in your best chair, and prepare to be transported to the world this exhibition begins to build, in the hopes we will meet one day.

It invites the audience to envision an existence of mutual respect, care, and survival. Artists Sofía Córdova, Beatriz Cortez, Candice Lin, Allison Smith, and Patrick Staff provide lenses for viewing time as malleable and circular—constructing a world where the future is, in fact, possible and within reach.<br> <br>This exhibition takes its name from Ursula K. Le Guin’s novella The Word for World is Forest. In the 1972 work, Le Guin imagines a future scenario where humans have created a colony on another planet to exploit the native population and strip the land of its resources, as they have done in reality many times over on this planet. The native community, called the Athsheans, live in peace and harmony with their surroundings. Athsheans see all beings as interconnected: In their language, the word for “world” and “forest” is the same. <br><br>As an experiment to align a curatorial vision with Le Guin, we strived to become human, become humus, or as ecofeminist and theorist Donna J. Haraway suggests, become-with her, rather than speak about her. Both Le Guin and the artists featured in The Word for World is Forest look to speculative fiction and its strategies to imagine new ways of being after trauma. A broader term encompassing genres such as science fiction, alternate history, fantasy, and utopian and dystopian fiction, speculative fiction carries the potential for imagination. The genre provides a platform to rewrite power structures—a space to envision anti-colonial or decolonial futures. Speculative fiction provides us with alternative futures and ways to move forward.  <br><br><i>The Vine May Take Over the Gallery</i><br><br>Many of the exhibition’s artworks utilize organic materials to create a new consciousness. Various plant lives are cherished for their intrinsic existence, and mutual care and respect are restored. The power relations between plant allies and human bodies are equalized.<br><br>Sofía Córdova’s new video, finished for this exhibition as part of her dawn chorus series (ongoing), takes place five hundred years in the future. Filmed in Finland, New Mexico, and Wisconsin, the work is a meditation on post-ecological collapse. Córdova imagines a future where the site of capitalistic worship has been destroyed and a deluge has left humanity in a state of ambivalence. The work opens with a poem by Puerto Rican poet and activist Julia de Burgos titled “Yo fui la mas callada” (“I Was the Quietest”). The poem tells a narrative marked by references to both the sea and desert. In the video, underlying imagery of barren sand dunes and lush green foliage are references to the Finnish Civil War and Hurricane Maria’s destruction in Puerto Rico. At times acting as protagonists, the forest and the desert become ever-present backdrops to Córdova’s historical retellings and futuristic speculations. <br><br>Candice Lin and Patrick Staff’s Hormonal Fog (2016–ongoing) sets the scene for a future where the body is truly malleable and vulnerable. Hormonal Fog is a smoke machine that makes use of homemade herbal tinctures to produce a smoke of hormones that lowers testosterone levels in the body. In a text written about this work, Lin and Staff ask, “What is ancient about herbalism and what is modern about gender transition? What is modern about herbalism, and what is ancient about transitioning?”1 This symbiotic relationship between body and plants brings us back to the words of Haraway. Her book Staying with the Trouble echoes the importance of an equitable relationship between humankind and nature as a way of recognizing the inalienable rights of all beings. She writes, <br><br>Instructed by companion species of the myriad terran kingdoms in all their placetimes, we need to reseed our souls and our home worlds in order to flourish—again, or maybe just for the first time—on a vulnerable planet that is not yet murdered…Recuperation is still possible, but only in multispecies alliance, across the killing divisions of nature, culture, and technology and of organism, language, and machine.2<br><br>The importance of a multispecies coalition in order to save the planet (and ourselves) cannot be denied. According to Haraway, a decolonized feminist future cannot exist with human beings at the top of a speciated hierarchy. We all must recognize that humanity has much to learn from our kindred species, and we are not the masters of the earth. The nonhuman kin that surrounds us has as much to contribute to the quality of life on this planet as we do, and have as much of a breathing, living consciousness—and right to exist—as we do.  <br><br>Haraway also cites Le Guin’s The Word for World is Forest as a narrative of the all-too-familiar struggle between colonization and a thriving multispecies planet. She states that one must look back to terraforming, to the cultivation of the earth and its sacred rights, to bring forth a future worth living.3 We must look to the seeds for knowledge and leadership. We must let the plants show us their voice.<br><br>Created by the curatorial cohort through the instruction and guidance of Beatriz Cortez and her collaborator Elizabeth Pérez Márquez, a garden, initially intended for the gallery, has been grown in our homes the main gallery. As Cortez notes—these plants are gifts from Indigenous ancestors across the Americas who preserved them for us. To create a generous exchange between the plants and humanity, we have included instructions for planting your own garden in the catalog. On the last day of the exhibition, the public would be invited to take an individual plant home with them, to care for and cultivate it for nourishment and for the generations who are yet to come.<br><br>To Dream Is to Act<br><br>In Le Guin’s novella, the Athsheans do not distinguish between dream-time and world-time. We echo this belief in our exhibition. All human beings share the ability to dream. Dreams mean. They are poems; reflections of disorganized thoughts; vivid, terrifying nocturnal episodes; experiences arising during sleep.  <br><br><br>The Athsheans dismantle any hierarchy between the real and the dreamt. Their radical idea pushes dreaming beyond mere speculation and solidifies it as equally valuable to our experiences in waking life. This practice is reflected in some of the artworks in the exhibition where the artist uses dreams as their guide to render tangible objects. It is the dreamers’ job to determine how to make use of their dreams and not dismiss the irrational simply because it may require decoding. While dreaming is often defined as an involuntary act, The Word for World is Forest asks to rethink it as a practice that should be cultivated and utilized. <br><br>What is a hallucination if not another strand of dreaming? This is dreaming that is self-induced through substances or resulting from extreme exhaustion. It can be no coincidence that the body produces visions after extreme amounts of pressure. For this Wattis presentation, Candice Lin’s Witness (Blue Version) and (Yellow Version) (both 2019) come to us from this sacred space. Lin conjured her own hallucinations by dosing herself with herbal tinctures.The tapestry worn as a yellow coat by one of the Witness figures is made from a drawing done under the influence of Datura metel (datura, devil’s trumpet), and the pattern for the blue coat was created under the influence of Papaver somniferum (opium poppy). Lin’s practice reaches beyond just possibilities. The ability of plants to have psychoactive effects on our consciousness is an example of intricacies of relationships across species. Her work takes into account the very real histories of migration and control, and the ways that race, gender, and economics shape our world. The masks worn by the Witness figures, which elicit medieval masks of shame, evoke dehumanization through humiliation. <br><br>Allison Smith enters a similar dream-like space through focused meditation. Instead of using plants, Smith uses carefully crafted devices that amplify her introspective state. Her sculptures titled Ritual Instruments for Addressing 400 Years of Trouble (Harms Done, Harm None) (2019–2020) are handmade objects that facilitate an attempt to heal the pain and grief caused by the artist’s ancestors. With unique personal stories, these objects provide a meditative space for the audience, often ready to be activated through private rituals. Her glass hearing trumpets take form as facilitators for deep listening. With these objects, Smith intends to make herself open to messages and visions that come from a deeper, practiced consciousness. Visitors to the exhibition are welcome to bring their ear to this instrument and engage in deliberate listening. <br><br>Similarly, the form of Smith’s urn-shaped instrument came to her in a vision. Rendered in ceramic, the urn is a physical manifestation of a form she was holding while receiving an ancestral transmission in a trance-like state of lucid dreaming: simultaneously a funerary urn, a baby, and the symbol we use in contemporary digital society as the podcast icon. By bringing visions like this into three-dimensional forms that can be used in ritual, the artist deepens a reciprocal relationship with the otherworldly to aid her confrontation with a complicated ancestral history.4<br>  <br>These works suggest that we can only begin to enact change in the world when we allow ourselves to dream. <br><br>Gathering There, Assembling Here<br><br>Beatriz Cortez’s Shields (2019) take the shape of three geodesic domes that occupy the gallery. Viewers are invited to crawl inside each of these tent-like structures. Made out of recycled materials, these sculptures both suggest nomadism as a choice for a future that echoes certain Indigenous ways of living, while raising awareness around the precarity of forced displacement and detention, alongside an unsustainable contemporary housing system. While Cortez’s domes offer a type of shelter, their material form ultimately negates their intended purpose. The steel and car hood metal that comprises these Shields makes them impossible for one person to lift alone. Their small size barely allows for a person to lie down. While Shields ultimately is not a sustainable housing structure, it does demonstrate a thinking toward alternatives for the future. Shields acknowledges the urgency required in the midst of a nationwide housing crisis, perhaps most prominently in San Francisco and the Bay Area.<br><br>Another two works in Smith’s Instrument series, which she refers to as Goddexx statues, are mounted sculptures made from found materials: a rock, sculpted by nature and found on a beach on an island off the coast of Maine, and lumpen metal, sculpted by a Northern California wildfire. By gathering and assembling these materials to create upright objects of worship of nonbinary orientation, Smith alters the notion of a divine feminine. These ready-made genderqueer statues draw on associations with historical “goddess” figures. To Smith, the statues represent a yearning for a pre-patriarchal symbiosis with nature, as well as a return to an ancient religious devotion to the natural world—a devotion that existed prior to the trouble caused by European migration and colonization of the new world.5 Smith’s European lineage migrated to North America and became settler colonizers—a fact that Smith also openly acknowledges in her work. Her objects carry the tension of migrative encounters and complicated histories, while also providing a hope for curative objects with the potential to heal past, present, and future generations.<br><br>As for the Indigenous community in The Word for World is Forest, histories of oppression and colonization cannot be forgotten even as we attempt to return to a decolonized understanding of our relationship to the planet.6 Despite the atrocities of our past, we can all recognize their existence and create something better. We can investigate ways to build on top, to replant displaced knowledge, and to cultivate new ideas within the soil that has already been tilled. The world as we know it may not need to be thrown away just to see something new.<br><br>ENDNOTES<br>1.

Kroeber—an anthropologist who extensively researched Indigenous people of Northern California, and who infamously claimed that the Esselen people were extinct. When Ishi, “the last known member of the Native American Yahi people,” emerged near Oroville, California, Kroeber was the one who brought him in for further study to the University of California, Berkeley. Ishi, at one point, was put on view at the Museum of Anthropology in San Francisco until his death from tuberculosis a few years later. See: Deborah A.

To Smith, the statues represent a yearning for a pre-patriarchal symbiosis with nature, as well as a return to an ancient religious devotion to the natural world—a devotion that existed prior to the trouble caused by European migration and colonization of the new world.(5) Smith’s European lineage migrated to North America and became settler colonizers—a fact that Smith also openly acknowledges in her work. Her objects carry the tension of migrative encounters and complicated histories, while also providing a hope for curative objects with the potential to heal past, present, and future generations.<br><br>As for the Indigenous community in <i>The Word for World is Forest</i>, histories of oppression and colonization cannot be forgotten even as we attempt to return to a decolonized understanding of our relationship to the planet.(6) Despite the atrocities of our past, we can all recognize their existence and create something better. We can investigate ways to build on top, to replant displaced knowledge, and to cultivate new ideas within the soil that has already been tilled. The world as we know it may not need to be thrown away just to see something new.<br><br><br><span style=\"border-bottom: solid;\">Endnotes</span><br><br>(1) Candice Lin and Patrick Staff, <a href = \'https://walkerart.org/magazine/candice-lin-patrick-staff-hormonal-fog\' target= new\'>“Reading And Smoking: Candice Lin and Patrick Staff on the Malleable Body,”</a> <i>Walker Reader</i>, October 1, 2019.<br>(2) Donna J.

Although Disney passed away in 1966, CalArts opened its doors to its first students in 1970. Much has been written about the notoriously chaotic early years of CalArts (1970-1975), during which a faculty of visionaries took Disney’s idea for a collaborative, creative community and created an interdisciplinary school with no curricula nor grades, focused on experimentation and individual self-discovery. There were no drawing courses, but students could participate in happenings with Dean Allan Kaprow, or take a class on rolling joints. In the Critical Studies department, one sociology class was in session any time the teacher saw one of his students on campus. (1)<br><br><img src=\"https://www.wattis.org/media/03120.jpg\"><br><br>Superlative examples aside, CalArts’ first teachers implemented radical pedagogical methods to provide students with tools to investigate the world and create original work informed by conceptual ideas. These were not literal tools; as Paul Brach, Dean of Art, put it, “Rather than learning techniques and attitudes based on ‘you never know when you\'ll need this,’ they started with the idea of ‘no information in advance of need.’” (2) Instead of teaching technical skills, teachers introduced students to theory, facilitated conversation, and shared research skills, aiming to inspire individual curiosity and germinate content-based artwork. Students’ individual creativity and ability to articulate their ideas was “tested” by frequent critiques. Ironically, these methods produced ambitious, competitive students who were well-prepared to enter the professional art world with unique work, fulfilling Disney’s wish that CalArts allow “the curious mind [to] seek its own path towards expression.” (3)<br><br>Of all the initial faculty, John Baldessari is most synonymous with the early identity of CalArts. Although he was hired in 1968 to teach painting, he quickly decided he wanted to create a more “broadly inclusive” class. Dubbed “Post-Studio,” Baldessari welcomed any student who ostensibly did anything other than paint. (4) Reflecting on his pedagogical approach in 2003, Baldessari said “while I didn’t think you could teach art, you could supply information.” To do this, he took his students on trips to see galleries and explore nature, and organized visits with artists from New York and Europe, such as Lawrence Weiner and Richard Serra. (5) When they met in the classroom, Baldessari presented students with materials such as exhibition catalogues, magazines, and pop culture ephemera to percolate ideas. (6)<br><br><img src=\"https://www.wattis.org/media/03121.jpg\"><br><br>Like most of the teachers at CalArts, Baldessari had no expectations for students’ material output – instead, he focused on providing resources and fostering generative discussion. Baldessari’s goal was not to teach technical skills, but to “set up a situation where art might happen.” (7) As artist Jack Goldstein recounts in <i>Jack Goldstein and the CalArts Mafia</i>, Post-Studio students “didn\'t get very much hands-on education, but [they] learned a whole new attitude about what art could be – not expression but investigation.” (8) By calling his course “Post-Studio” instead of “Conceptual Art,” Baldessari also enabled his students to pursue unique ideas and aesthetics, rather than emulate his work. (9)<br><br>In his own words, Baldessari “didn’t want to call [the class] ‘Conceptual art’ because I wasn’t sure that’s what I was doing.” (10) But by 1968, he was exploring ideas that would become core to this artistic movement. Baldessari had been teaching art and creating his own paintings since the mid-1950s. But in 1970, he had all his paintings (1953-66) destroyed in a performative gesture titled <i>Cremation Project</i>. The ashes of the works were collected into boxes, except for a portion which Baldessari baked into cookies. <i>Cremation Project</i> marked Baldessari’s move from traditional painting to, as Lynne Cooke describes it, “a realm of activity which had no boundaries,” with specific attention paid to the definition of what an art object could be made of or look like. (11) Around the same time, he created <i>Wrong</i> (1966-68), in which he hired a sign painter to scrawl “WRONG” underneath a photo that went against the conventions of “good” photography taught in art schools and reinforced by the art market. <i>Wrong</i> demonstrated Baldessari’s interest in core tropes of conceptualism, such as the removal of the artist’s hand. But <i>Wrong</i> also represented Baldessari’s foray into critiquing fine art pedagogy and the definition of “good” or “correct” art in his own work. <br><br><img src=\"https://www.wattis.org/media/03122.jpg\"><br><br>After starting at CalArts, he continued to interrogate pedagogical methods he deemed outdated or insufficient through works such as <i>Teaching a Plant the Alphabet</i> (1972). In the video, Baldessari holds up cards bearing each letter of the alphabet beside a small houseplant and repeats them aloud several times. Even if the plant had ears or eyes, this “lesson” would hardly convey the idea of language, for which the alphabet is a building block. In this way, the work highlights what Baldessari sees as the fundamental flaw in arts pedagogy, wherein skills are taught devoid of their potential to carry greater meaning. As a video, this work also signals Baldessari’s shift towards multimedia art in the 1970s, which was likely enabled by the seemingly endless resources afforded to CalArts students and faculty thanks to the Disney fortune.<br><br>None of Baldessari’s works blur the line between teaching and art-making quite like <i>List of Art Ideas</i>. Distributed on the first day of Post-Studio class, this literal list featured vague provocations and open-ended questions designed to interrogate the authority and limitations of the concept of the art assignment, such as “#37: What kind of work can be done literally under the earth,” or “#102: Composition based on the duration of, say, one gal. of paint.” <i>List of Art Ideas</i> has inspired innumerable artists since, including at the Wattis, which held an exhibition entitled <a href=\"http://archive.wattis.org/exhibitions/john-baldessari-class-assignments-optional\"><i>John Baldessari: Class Assignments (Optional)</i></a> in 2012. <br><br><img src=\"https://www.wattis.org/media/03123.jpg\"><br><br>The exhibition featured more than 65 works created by students from California College of the Arts’ MFA program, all inspired by Baldessari’s <i>List of Art Ideas</i> prompts. Instead of wall labels, visitors were provided with an annotated version of the complete list. To identify the artist behind each work, visitors first needed to deduce the assignment to which it responded. In this way, the artworks relied upon the <i>List of Art Ideas</i> to complete them, making the list inextricable from the work, as if Baldessari and the artists were collaborators. By offering the <i>List of Art Ideas</i> provocation to students, the Wattis exhibition echoed and explored Baldessari’s non-hierarchical and hands-on approach to arts education. <i>John Baldessari: Class Assignments (Optional)</i> was held on the heels of a major international retrospective of Baldessari\'s career, thus offering an alternative way of examining Baldessari’s work and pedagogy and alluding to their inseparability. (12)<br><br><img src=\"https://www.wattis.org/media/03167.jpg\"><br><br>Baldessari himself realized many of the prompts from <i>List of Art Ideas</i> throughout his career – in fact, one of his most famous works from the 1970s appears on the list: “#45: Punishment. Write ‘I will not make any more boring art; 1000 times on wall.” In 1971, Baldessari executed this work by “assigning” it to students at the Nova Scotia School of Art and Design. As Jacqueline Ardam points out in her article “On Not Teaching Art: Baldessari, Pedagogy, and Conceptualism,” the work thus echoed the antiquated schoolroom punishment of writing lines on a chalkboard to engrain a message in the student’s head, yet another pedagogical method which Baldessari sought to disparage. (13)<br><br>In a way, Conceptual art is founded on the same pillars as CalArts itself: prioritizing the strength of one’s ideas and creativity above craft, with no preconceived notions of what the final product should look like. (14) In fact, Disney himself had hoped that CalArts would teach students the “wedding of many techniques, that the new may have unexpected beginnings…[and] commonplace materials suddenly take on fresh forms.” (15) It perhaps comes as no surprise, then, that Baldessari’s pedagogy is inseparable from his art practice of the early 1970s. But, importantly, Baldessari was <i>able</i> to effectively explore his interest in such concepts by teaching the Post-Studio class. <br><br>As Baldessari’s practice evolved, he continued to teach, mentoring hundreds of students over his nearly 50-year career. CalArts’ John Baldessari Studios, dedicated in 2015, stand as a testament to the significant impact he had on the school and generations of students there. But the studios also serve as a monument to his commitment to radical arts education, through teaching as well as his own practice. <br><br>*<br><br><img src=\"https://www.wattis.org/media/03169.jpg\"><br><br>*<br><br>Emily Markert is a Curatorial Fellow at the Wattis and a graduate student in CCA\'s Curatorial Practice Program, class of 2021.<br><br><br>Notes:<br>(1) John Baldessari, “A Situation Where Art Might Happen: John Baldessari on CalArts,” interview by Christopher Knight, <i>East of Borneo</i>, November 19, 2011, <a href=\"https://eastofborneo.org/articles/a-situation-where-art-might-happen-john-baldessari-on-calarts\">https://eastofborneo.org/articles/a-situation-where-art-might-happen-john-baldessari-on-calarts</a>.<br>(2) Paul Brach, “Cal Arts: The Early Years,” <i>Art Journal</i> 42, no. 1 (Spring 1982): 29.<br>(3) “The CalArts Story,” filmed c. 1964 in Los Angeles, CA, video, 15:12, <a href=\"https://calarts.edu/about/institute/history\">https://calarts.edu/about/institute/history</a>.<br>(4) John Baldessari, “Reflections by John Baldessari” in <i>Jack Goldstein and the CalArts Mafia</i>, ed.

Here, Waiters and Ourahmane discuss works in <i>Solar Cry</i> and the artist\'s explorations of engagement with the community in Algeria under conditions of shelter-in-place. <br><br>To view some of the works mentioned in this dialogue, which took place by Skype on March 24, 2020, look at Ourahmane\'s Wattis exhibition <a href = \'/gallery/lydia-ourahmane-%C3%B8%C2%B5%C3%B8-%C3%B8-%C3%B8-%C3%B8-u-%C3%B8%C2%B3us%C3%B8-solar-cry-2020\'>here</a>.<br><br>*<br><br>Hannah Waiters: So how are you, considering all things COVID-19? <br><br>Lydia Ourahmane: Every day has felt so different. To be honest at the beginning it was quite suffocating. More in the sense of this swelling intensity on a global scale where we all experienced a very active coming apart, coming into immediate effect for those most vulnerable. Of course, we knew how precarious our modes of existence were, but the violence of negligence and the immense pressure of loss in every aspect are very heavy to process. The energy necessary to recalibrate is a daily task, but on a collective level I think we bear the responsibility of consciousness, and we have to allow for it to move us to care.<br><br>HW: With regards to the recalibration of process, I was going to ask you to say a bit about upcoming projects and practice. The methodologies used to create the exhibition <i>Solar Cry</i> involved travel, movement, and a broad sense of connection. The last time you and I met, you mentioned that your studio has always been your laptop—the digital space that simulates embodied experiences. We see how your installations are experimenting with ways that hope behaves as a transmission, transmission of narrative, transmission of connection. It becomes a broadcast and digital space that projects hope within the violence of national borders. So how are you recalibrating your methodologies of making and storytelling at this time?<br><br>LO: I think this is what the internet was made for, this very moment! <br><br>Algeria has been closed now since mid-March, as in strict curfews, airports closed, etc. I had previously made plans to be here to prepare for this film I was going to shoot in the desert in April. Obviously, it’s not going to happen like I thought it would. I was working hard on getting permission from the military to take a crew of non-Algerians to a site in between Libya and Algeria, a plateau in Tassili N’Ajjer, which has been closed to foreigners since 2011 and is where the photographs in <i>Solar Cry</i> (e.g. <i>The Neolithic Tumulus</i>) were taken . I was due to go there and shoot a film and had anticipated a few people coming out. I stupidly cleared my account by panic-buying all this 16mm film and various pieces of equipment, hoping we could still make it. But at the last minute, the borders closed…which just means we will have to wait for now.<br><br>My studio is just my laptop, two phones, and wherever I happen to be at the time. But it’s more just a means to connect to a network of people spread out across various places, disciplines, and expertise. My personal relationships with people are sort of the only consistent “material” I have…which I’m very used to maintaining from a distance, online, over the phone just because of always living in different places and moving around a lot. Obviously it’s very difficult not to be able to see the people you love but you learn how to love from afar, you just have to get better at other ways of communication, like telepathy! Ha ha—which I feel has been very strong lately…<br><br>I realised I would have to find a different way of working which doesn’t rely so heavily on my physical mobility or lack thereof. But then there are still people everywhere, we just need to shift the focus more on collaborative efforts, things can still be filmed elsewhere by others for example. I’m definitely trying to focus on what is possible, but I’m also very conscious about taking this time as it is, to let it happen, not to continue trying to live for a future when we all “get out.” I’ve been feeling this for a long time—the art world as we know it is completely unsustainable. So many resources go into maintaining this global roaming economy which inevitably results in a lot of waste; a lot of energy is required to maintain speed, you know. And I feel it is necessary for us to consider other modes of transmission, other ways to maintain focus without misunderstanding activity in terms of pure motion. I am also speaking to myself here. It’s strange, and I kept having a looming premonition of this year not happening, or a major shift at least. I kept thinking that it was because I was going to die. I didn’t die. The universe just held up a mirror! <br><br><img src=\'https://www.wattis.org/media/03219.jpg\'><br><br>HW: I love the metaphor of the mirror because it conceptualizes that we are, in fact, alive in a given space; quarantine is solipsism. Thinking back to <i>Solar Cry</i>, I am intrigued by how you use distance as a material in the exhibition. The exhibition is in part about how you and your family found miracles—formless spaces for possibilities—within government restrictions and invisible boundaries in Algeria. In conditions of quarantine, where Algeria has a strict curfew, how are your current process and inspiration transcending these boundaries of isolation quarantine? In a broader sense, would you say that this isolated space that is being reflected back at us is a miracle?<br><br>LO: I think this isolation has been a very different experience for everyone. Even if we usually spend a lot of time alone, there is the obvious difference of choice. We are having to undo the way that distance was previously collapsed by transcontinental flying, for example. Now that borders are suddenly a reality for everyone, we have to accept our immediate circumstances, and the restrictions implied by “slowing down.” But I can’t really get romantic about this sort of solitude.<br><br>On a conscious level, we are all dealing with a lot. There is a general pressure to maintain “momentum,” but I’m not sure it’s productive, as much as it serves as a coping mechanism or distraction or optimism I don’t know. I just remembered a conversation I had with my mum some time last year, found in notes:<br><br>“It’s good to come to the end of ourselves, then we have to look up and receive the supernatural, we have to empty ourselves till there is nothing left, in the end, in nothingness, this is when you start to receive. Hopelessness is the best state.”<br><br><img src=\'https://www.wattis.org/media/03217.jpg\'><br><br>HW: Such poetics are suggestive of the auratic landscape you helped audiences imagine in the exhibition <i>Solar Cry</i>.  A song-filled space where an opera singer sings in two notes with subtle variations, creating an improvised sacred hymn drenched in hypnotic blue light. In fact, most of your works use recordings, vibrations, and empty space to develop a sense of disembodiment of sacred ground. Empty space represents the great distance between the artworks’ present location and their conceptual origins. For instance, <i>Gold Digger</i>, the metal detector that listened to the piece of gold embedded in the Wattis floor. Can you say a bit about this piece? And also, can you describe the piece for those who haven’t seen it?<br><br>LO: In its current version, <i>Gold Digger</i> is a metal detector propped against the back wall of the Wattis, with headphones plugged into the device so you can hear that something is being detected, but it’s still intended for private use. The device is activated by one gram of gold, which is set into the concrete floor, causing it to make this undulating sound, as it seeks this embedded, invisible material. <br><br>But actually, that piece is still ongoing. It’s promised to someone I met in the desert, one of the guides who led me through Tassili N’ajjer. He had this low husky voice you could barely find his words through. He told me, <br><blockquote><i>this is the voice of a person who was lost in the desert for five days without food or water.</i></blockquote><br>There are a lot of people in the south of Algeria who dig for gold. It’s illegal. Anything you find you are supposed to hand over to the police. He and his friend had been searching an area last year in July. They journeyed down to the mines and spent three days digging with all their equipment—metal detectors, torches, etc.—and finally hit gold. Then they saw the military coming. So they dropped their equipment and ran with as much gold as they could carry. They lost their track between running and hiding and ended up near Niger. It was July, and they had no food or water. He was describing the hallucinations he was having as he was coming in and out of consciousness. He experienced these visions of spirits coming to take his soul and having to fight them, exclaiming <br><blockquote><i>it’s not my time to die</i></blockquote><br>I asked, “Will you make a movie about gold-digging with me?” And told him that I wanted to see the mines because that\'s what he does. He’s currently working as a guide to make money to buy the equipment that he needs for gold-digging. And he responded, <br><blockquote><i>Yeah, of course. When we dropped everything, we lost all of our equipment, and that’s why I am trying to save up.</i></blockquote><br>So we made a deal:<br><blockquote><i>If I get you this metal detector, will you make this movie with me?</i></blockquote><br>I say movie very abstractly. I think I use the apparatus of moving images as a way of focusing a narrative, but it’s also just a natural response to record and document things. But shooting is more a way of thinking through, it offers an instantaneous distance that I can figure out later.<br><br>HW: Is it through these stories that your personal experience has been made more accessible to tell? <br><br>LO: Well, we only exist really in relation to each other. You share stories and experiences as a way of forging connections. Essentially we were just sitting around a fire after sharing a meal, having walked together that day. Stories are always shared experiences, and they live with you, live on through you. I think that is what is particularly difficult for everyone in this moment, we weren’t prepared for this forced separation. But of course, there are always other ways to feel like presence is still shared. I have been on the go for a while and it’s very hard to find the energy to stop, so this has been a blessing, actually. I feel very grateful at this moment to be able to be with my parents, who I hadn’t spent real time with for a while—and being able to write and think and work not only toward deadlines. I was reading a section this morning in Edouard Glissant\'s book, <i>Poetics of Relation</i>. The chapter “The Black Beach” is about someone moving so fast because if they stopped, they would fall apart. It felt prophetic, and I think we are navigating a significant global shift, it’s really only the beginning. <br><blockquote><i>But, while I was wandering like this, a silence as dizzying as speed and disorder gradually rose from the uproar of the sea. The voiceless man who walks keeps on carting his black sand from a distant volcano known only to himself, to the beaches he pretends to share with us. How can he run faster when he is growing so desperately thin? One of us whispers: “He goes faster and faster because if he stops, if he slows down—he will fall”<br><br>We are not going any faster, we are all hurtling onward—for fear of falling.</i><br><br>– Edouard Glissant, <a href = \'https://trueleappress.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/glissant-poetics-of-relation.pdf\' target= \'new\'><i>Poetics of Relation</i></a>, pg.127</blockquote><br><img src=\'https://www.wattis.org/media/03218.jpg\'><br><br>LO: The <i>Neolithic Tumulus</i> is one of few such archeological sites in Tassili N\'Ajjer, Djanet. This one is enclosed, which means the burial of that family was finished, or that the tribe had moved, which seems plausible in relation to environmental changes the area went through in its eventual becoming like a desert. Experts say it would have been the ruler of the tribe. I also heard that when the ruler dies, he is buried with all his remaining belongings to take them into the afterlife; this includes clothes, cattle, his wives, who would be killed and buried with him, etc. The remains of things like this were found in excavations of similar tombs. The tombs remain as mounds, marked by the piling of rocks in a “keyhole” formation. I’ve come across other burial grounds in different areas of the Sahara that are maybe less obvious than this one, and I’ve always been fascinated that no one has moved them for thousands of years. There’s a kind of inherited instruction not to desecrate the sites. Also, the moving of the burial stones is said to carry curses, probably to prevent robbery, etc. But superstitions are genuinely adhered to. At the same time, the moving of stones for other reasons is an interest of mine. For instance, on the plateau, our guides would pile stones in stacks of three, very low, almost unnoticeable, as a marking of the way—this stacking indicates human intervention; it is a way of communication and is timeless in that sense, non-linguistic, understood. I’m also really interested in superstition as a form of law. Superstitions exist because of collective belief, which reinforces them as law. Also, I’m obsessed with these keyhole tombs; on a formal level, they mark an entryway into the underworld. Energetically, the site was very concentrated. These images of stones are inscribing a tale of what was erased, a connection in displacement, a tradition of discourse. <br><br>HW: Thank you so much for sharing the backdrops to these works. Before we wrap up, one more question about communications across distance. Since digital space seems more valuable than ever in regards to sharing anecdotes, historical dimensions, and myths, are there any online platforms that you have been contributing to recently that audiences can follow? <br><br>LO: I made a playlist called “Music to sleep to” for Chisenhale Gallery which you can listen to <a href = \'https://soundcloud.com/chisenhale-gallery/lydia-ourhamane-music-to-sleep-to-2020\' target= \'new\'>here</a>; and have been contributing to <i><a href = \'https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UuCDWeXRE_x7K3UwQYe1nY8c5J5GVx8TJq8uqHV7H-E/edit#bookmark=id.x3rf0rcf6oqs\' target= \'new\'>____homecooking____</a></i> which is a digest of new works, activities, poetry, movement, and events begun in March 2020 founded by the wonderful Asad Raza and organized in collaboration with Marianna Simnett.<br><br>IRL—We have been distributing weekly food packages to families who have been affected by COVID-19 in the Kabyle region near my parents’ community. And, more recently I’ve been coordinating and redirecting some of that aid by working with a collective of people from the Sub-Saharan region; Côte D’Ivoire, Senegal, Mali, Benin and Niger to provide food packages for the largely undocumented community or those who are still awaiting asylum here in Algiers. We are trying figure out how to continue this work strategically and think about other areas of support amidst a deeply complex situation. But for now, our endeavor is to meet the most urgent and immediate needs. <br><br><img src=\'https://www.wattis.org/media/03249.jpeg\'><br><br>Hannah Waiters is an artist, educator and researcher in pursuit of her MFA/MA in Fine Arts and Visual and Critical Studies at CCA, class of 2021.<br><br>Lydia Ourahmane is an artist who had a solo exhibition at the Wattis in 2020, available <a href = \'/gallery/lydia-ourahmane-%C3%B8%C2%B5%C3%B8-%C3%B8-%C3%B8-%C3%B8-u-%C3%B8%C2%B3us%C3%B8-solar-cry-2020\'>here</a>.<br>',''),(1091,1,'2020-06-24 00:54:17','2020-07-20 20:27:18',NULL,'Trinh T.

Click <a href = \'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gckA2gFEel0\' target= \'new\'>here</a> to join the screening. <br><br>Before watching, consider the 1927 novella that Trinh pays tribute to, <I>Milky Way Railroad</I> by Kenji Miyazawa. The Japanese children’s book tells the story of Giovanni, a boy with a difficult home life who also struggles as <a href=\"https://www.wattis.org/media/03212.pdf\">an outcast at school</a>. On the night of the Festival of the Stars, Giovanni and his only friend, Campanella, are transported to <a href=\"https://www.wattis.org/media/03206.pdf\">a train ride through the universe</a>, during which they <a href=\"https://www.wattis.org/media/03205.pdf\">meet and learn</a> from many new people.<br><br>[image1]<br><br>Think also of the <a href=\"https://www.wattis.org/media/03208.pdf\">interview with Alison Rowley</a>, in which Trinh notes, “Life is not explicable when it is lived intensely, with magical freshness. What I kept of Miyazawa in <I>Night Passage</I> were spirit, structural forces, and field of action.”<br><br>In our research, we found that <a href=\"https://youtu.be/O_3SvpTH_pk?t=4878\">Miyazawa’s train ride</a> has inspired many. For example, consider <a href=\"https://blautoothdmand.wordpress.com/2017/10/17/why-the-train-scene-in-spirited-away-is-my-favorite-work-by-miyazaki/\">the train that journeys between worlds</a> in the 2001 Studio Ghibli classic, <a href=\"https://www.wattis.org/media/03211.pdf\"><I>Spirited Away</I></a>. <br><br>[image2][image3]<br><br>Through her recreation of Miyazawa’s train ride, Trinh demonstrates that \"<a href=\"https://www.wattis.org/media/03209.pdf\">hearing is never linear</a>.” Throughout <I>Night Passage</I>, pay particular attention to how Trinh treats “sound not as sound effects but as music, making full use of the forbidden yield of what the classic, musically trained ear calls ‘noise’ or ‘nonmusical.’” Think, too, of how this relates to the <a href=\"https://www.wattis.org/media/03210.pdf\">film narrative’s overall linearity</a>.<br><br>*<br><br>During <a name=\"week2\"><a href=\"/calendar/july-9-16-23-2020/trinh-t-minh-ha-film-club-notes\">Week 2</a></a>, we watch <i>The Fourth Dimension</i> (2001). Click <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ReAohuh5os&feature=youtu.be\"> here </a> to join the screening. <br><br>We <a href=\"https://www.wattis.org/media/03256.pdf\">follow the train</a> that drives the nonlinear narrative of <i>Night Passage</i> to <i>The Fourth Dimension</i>. While <i>Night Passage</i> is a fictional film, <i>The Fourth Dimension</i> is a documentary (although Trinh often <a href = \'https://frieze.com/article/there-no-such-thing-documentary-interview-trinh-t-minh-ha\' target= \'new\'>eschews</a> this categorization of her “non-fiction” films). <i>The Fourth Dimension</i>’s train serves as a vehicle for meditation on time, ritual, language, and modernity, as Trinh turns her anthropological eye to <a href=\"https://www.wattis.org/media/03257.pdf\">Japanese culture</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.wattis.org/media/03258.pdf\">subject matter of <i>The Fourth Dimension</i> is reinforced by the medium of the film itself</a>, as this is Trinh’s first work produced using a digital video camera.<br><br>Just as sound plays an integral role in disrupting the linearity and predictability of <i>Night Passage</i>, language is a key element of <i>The Fourth Dimension</i>. Consider how pace and intonation enable <a href=\"https://www.wattis.org/media/03259.pdf\">language to act as a score</a> or as choreography.<br><br>Trinh narrates <i>The Fourth Dimension</i> in English, but words are spoken or shown on screen in Japanese from time to time. Think too of <a href=\"https://www.wattis.org/media/03260.pdf\">the historical context of the year 2001</a> and how this impacts our understanding of the intermingling of English and Japanese languages throughout the film. <br><br>Trinh’s musical treatment of language pairs with her focus on time and progress, both through the narrative of the film and through the experience as a viewer. Consider how Trinh uses <a href=\"https://www.wattis.org/media/03261.pdf\">slowness and resistance to speed as a tactic</a> to encourage a new way of seeing; how she juxtaposes “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=108d4KnZPxo\">Noh time</a>” and “train time,” or tradition and modernity, in relation to her search for a <a href=\"https://www.wattis.org/media/03265.pdf\">third interval</a> between time and space. Consider how Trinh chooses to name this interval <a href=\"https://www.wattis.org/media/03262.pdf\">“Women’s Time.”</a><br><br>*<br><br><a name=\"week3\"><a href=\"/calendar/july-9-16-23-2020/trinh-t-minh-ha-film-club-notes\">Week 3</a></a> we are watching <i>Surname Việt Given Name Name</i> (1989). Click <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19w_ak8TqFA&feature=youtu.be\"> here </a> to join the screening.<br><br>This film is a documentary, but does it present the truth? In it we follow four Vietnamese women living in America. First, they recount what we think are personal experiences of their time in Vietnam. They speak in English, <a href=\"https://www.wattis.org/media/03281.pdf\">with heavy accents</a>. As their mouths move, mis-matched subtitles and seemingly unrelated audio ask us to question the film’s authority and accuracy. <br><br>In reality, these accounts are lifted from <a href=\"https://www.wattis.org/media/03282.pdf\">Mai Thu Vân’s 1983 book <i>Việtnam: un peuple, des voix</i></a>, which presented interviews conducted in Vietnamese and then translated into French. Trinh then translated portions of the book into English. While the stories recited in the film are true, <a href = \'https://translationtransmission.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/surnameviet_a.jpg?w=598&h=454\' target= \'new\'>they were not experienced by the women on screen</a>. Consider the implications of authorship as it relates not only to filmmaking, but translation.<br><br>The title of the film--the earliest of Trinh’s films we have screened--refers to a famous quote from Vietnamese anti-colonial nationalist Phan Bội Châu (1867-1940), in which he stated that unmarried women should identify themselves as “My surname is Việt, given name is Nam.” In other words, <a href=\"https://www.wattis.org/media/03283.pdf\">women belong either to the state or to a man</a>.<br><br>Halfway through the film, the women switch from scripted stories to personal ones. This film not explores <a href=\"https://www.wattis.org/media/03284.pdf\">multiplicity through the act of interviews and translation</a>, but also through the many roles Vietnamese women are expected to play in society. As with many of her later films, <i>Surname Việt</i> posits that women’s bodies are the <a href = \'https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQUF2b210I7X7S09ZVsS6IJGWUoKhYHARefRg&usqp=CAU\' target= \'new\'>site of translation</a>.<br><br>*<br><br><br><a name=\"week4\"><a href=\"/calendar/july-9-16-23-2020/trinh-t-minh-ha-film-club-notes\">Week 4</a></a> we watch <i>A Tale of Love</i> (1995). Click <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kudaw-ad2A0&feature=youtu.be\">here</a> to join the screening. <br><br>Similar to the way that Trinh structured <i>Night Passage</i> around a Japanese classic, <i>A Tale of Love</i> embodies the epic Vietnamese poem, <i>The Tale of Kiều</i></a>. Written by the early 19th-century poet Nguyễn Du, the poem is regarded as the most significant in Vietnamese literature. It tells the tragic story of a <a href=\"https://www.wattis.org/media/03278.pdf\">talented woman</a> who gets trapped in a cycle of sex work and servitude in order to save her family from hardship. <br><br>In Trinh’s version, Kiều is a young Vietnamese writer who supplements her income by working as a model while researching <i>The Tale of Kiều</i> for a women’s magazine. The photographer Kiều works with insists that his female models wear veils and <a href = \'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZR06JJWaJM\' target= \'new\'>look away from his camera</a>. Consider <a href=\"https://www.wattis.org/media/03279.pdf\">Hélène Cixous’s “Castration or Decapitation?”</a> as Kiều tells her photographer, “You don’t want a nude; what you want is a female body without a head.”<br><br>As Lan P. Duong points out, Kiều takes on multiple professional roles, in addition to roles as a lover and a daughter, representing “a metonymic figure for diasporic women and their storytelling agency.” Think of how Trinh interrogates the act of translation and explores multiplicity through narrative filmmaking. <br><br>Trinh’s Kiều moves between objective and subjective positions in a nonlinear narrative that blends reality with dreams, memories, and fantasy. Consider the parallels drawn between love, writing and sensuality and how these relate to voyeurism in <a href=\"https://www.wattis.org/media/03280.pdf\">Gwendolyn Foster’s 1997 interview with Trinh</a>. <br> <br>///<a href=\"/calendar/july-9-16-23-2020\">Trinh T.

In this spirit, the project emphasizes process and open participation, unfolding as a collection of workbooks, in-progress essays and writing, half-formed ideas, and research notes—forms Rasheed refers to as “leaky and wet.” The project culminates in a publication with the remnants of our engagement and an essay in progress. <br><br><a href = \'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gqEboD4XOM9B30rE7jr1DtmYUKZt2Du2/view?usp=sharing\' target= \'new\'>Click here</a> to download the first workbook. <br><br>This project is the third iteration of Rasheed’s ongoing work <i>Scoring the Stacks</i>, previously presented at the Brooklyn Public Library and Haverford College.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.kameelahr.com/\">Kameelah Janan Rasheed</a> is a Brooklyn-based learner from East Palo Alto, CA.

It’s where we go to feel safe and protected, to put our guard down, rest, and build ourselves back up. It’s our innermost sanctuary, our last line of defense: when everything feels like it’s falling apart, we can always just stay in bed. At the same time, the bedroom is where we go to expose ourselves to others, to test and experiment with what our bodies want and need from and can do to other bodies—which can be soft and sensual but can also get loud, sweaty, and even a bit rough. For those (and many other) reasons, the bedroom needs a door that closes, so that it can be kept separate from the rest of the house. It’s where private gets even more private, or, as my aunt Judy likes to say, it’s the <i>indoors indoors</i>. And even though it’s our most familiar place (considering we’re there for hours every single day), it’s also our most sacred and cherished possession, shared with others only at personal risk. <br><br>[image1]<br><br>Sure, some keep their bedrooms as neat as possible, with clothes put away, bed made, and blankets folded, hoping it can remain calm and orderly. But there is nothing <i>neat</i> about our emotional lives—and it’s those lives, in all of their uncontrollable furies, that we experience most intensely in the bedroom.<br><br>In her writing, Bellamy is constantly contending with the messiness of her emotions. Her aim is never to contain or clean them up but to keep them difficult, uncomfortable, unshapeable. Her own <i>Barf Manifesto</i> (2008) makes it crystal clear: she wants an art of excess, one that says too much, where “meaning is so surplus it decimates form,” and/or the other way around: where “form is so vicious it beats the fucking pony of content to bits.” The Barf describes her literary form: “feminist, unruly, cheerfully monstrous . . . an upheaval, born of our hangover from imbibing too much Western Civ.” It makes a mess of meaning. <br><br>To barf (or vomit, puke, heave, hurl, throw up, etc.) points to a fragility: it comes from the body, is <i>of</i> the body but is too much for it, is rejected by the body, and therefore erupts from it, whether we like it or not. It represents a threat—most people don’t want to see it, or at least not out in the open. Barf is far too horrifying and abject for that. At the same time, it shares a lot in common with <i>the passionate</i>, as opposed to <i>the intellectual</i>: it doesn’t come loaded with self-consciousness or moral superiority but only with force and materiality. It doesn’t have good or bad intentions, nor does it have right or wrong opinions. It simply <i>happens</i>, inevitably, like shit. Or like laughter.<br><br>The metaphor of a literary Barf works so well for Bellamy because what she’s after, in her own words, is to enact the feral. She wants to rip narrative out of its domesticated form and <i>rewild</i> it, no matter how menacing that might be. In that sense, the Barf is a sign of strength, not weakness: it indicates a willingness to remain raw, vulnerable, exposed, and subject to the judgment of others. And so Bellamy proceeds to love too much and to say too much. This is her feminism, her political stance: to empower the wild and the <i>too much</i>. In her mind, a good essay should always embarrass its author a bit.<br><br>As a result, when Bellamy is faced with a problem, she exaggerates the problem. When she feels vulnerable, she exposes herself. When she gets humiliated, she tells everyone. When she is faced with her own body’s limitations, she “ram[s] it down my readers’ throats.” In <i>Academonia</i> (2006), she confesses that “there are things that are wrong with me. I’m a woman. I write about sex. I’m too old. I’m too weird. I’m white. I’m a white woman who’s too old to write about sex.” As Kaye Mitchell argues, shame is not something Bellamy tries to overcome but something she works to immerse herself in. She pushes humiliation as far as it will stretch until it flips over and becomes arousal. She calls it “an erotics of disclosure.”<br><br>It’s important to clarify that Bellamy doesn’t see her work as transgressive or radical. She’s not trying to convince anyone of that, least of all with anything resembling rational arguments, sincerity, morality, coherence, or “truth,” whatever that means. She sees so-called “sophistication” as something that can only get in the way. She’s more interested in subverting what’s considered “important” subject matter. Her writing, at least in part, comes from the unconscious or the impulsive, which are often too vulgar and too barfy to form a single acceptable message. Instead, she’s interested in how the sexual consumes and devours rationality, making it impossible—how the physicality of sex will always elude language. Therefore, inspired by her friend Kathy Acker, she doesn’t write poems or novels <i>about</i> sex but imagines ways the writing itself could contain a sexual force. For both Acker and Bellamy, stealing or appropriating language from others is a libidinal process that satisfies an urge to take, suck, and consume other people. In each sentence, words grab and clutch on to other words, fearlessly but also desperately, no matter how traumatic some might be. In Bellamy’s work, language feels hungry, potentially insatiable, as if it were trying to sink its teeth into our necks, like the vampire-protagonist of her first novel, <i>The Letters of Mina Harker</i> (1998). Her body is always entangled with ours. <br><br>Dodie Bellamy’s writing is dangerous in the way addictions are dangerous: readers will find it impossible to keep themselves at a safe distance from her words. <br><br>*<br><br>This essay is an excerpt of the introduction to <i>Dodie Bellamy is on our mind</i>, which can be purchased <a href = \'/buy-catalogues/dodie-bellamy-is-on-our-mind-25\'>here</a>.

Though best known for her painting <i>The Rose</i>, 1958-66, she worked across a variety of media, including drawing, collage, and photography, often creating works that defy singular categorization. Photography in particular enabled DeFeo to experiment with themes and forms she continually returned to in her practice. She also used the camera to capture her own process, resulting in a body of images that blur the line between documentation and art. <br><br>Although DeFeo exhibited her paintings widely, she is only known to have shown her photographs publicly once during her lifetime.

Oakland, 1952). <br><br>As a filmmaker known for his radical use of “found footage,” Baldwin engages adversarially with, and talks back to, mainstream media. He creates wildly imaginative works that profoundly challenge the nature of one-way media consumption. As a curator of the long-running <i>Other Cinema</i> series at San Francisco’s <a href=\"http://www.atasite.org\" target =\'new\'>Artists’ Television Access</a>, Baldwin expresses a radically expanded approach in which ephemeral forms of film history coexist alongside expanded cinema performance, underground film screenings, speculative lecture presentations, in-person artists, and more. Meticulously detailed and lavishly illustrated, <i>Avant to Live!</i> features contributions from over 50 writers, artists, and ideologues, serving as a comprehensive chronicle of the charmed artist’s life and work.<br><br>In this online event, <i>Avant To Live’s</i> co-editors <a href=\"http://www.brettkashmere.com\" target=\'new\'>Brett Kashmere</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sfcinematheque.org/about/staff/\" target =\'new\'>Steve Polta</a> discuss their work on this monumental project. They survey the book’s contents, give a visual presentation of anomalous artifacts from the obsessive self-documenter’s vast personal ephemera archive, share an excerpt from Baldwin’s newly digitized found-footage essay <i>Wild Gunman</i> (1978), and present an online premiere of Baldwin’s “lost/rediscovered” early Super 8 performance film, the barnstorming ‘70s cinema time capsule <i>Stolen Movie</i> (1976). <br><br>About the films: <br><i>Wild Gunman</i>: Mobilizing wildly diverse found-footage fragments, obsessive optical printing, and a dense “musique concrète” soundtrack, a maniac montage of pop-cultural amusements, cowboy iconography, and advertising imagery is re-contextualized within the contemporary geopolitical crisis in a scathing critique of U.S. cultural and political imperialism. Thanks to Anthology Film Archives.<br><br><i>Stolen Movie</i>: Armed with a Super 8 camera and sound-person (John Corser), Baldwin runs both recording devices continuously through single-take raids on a series of SF Market Street grindhouse theaters.

Conceived during this pandemic era, the immersive video work depicts the American flag in unsettling stillness, as a marker of territory, and projected onto bodies, while set to a heartrending soundtrack. At once melancholic and beautiful, Gibson renders the iconic image of the flag as both elastic and unyielding. The slow transformation through time, color, and form reflects both a distillation of our social collapse and the reinvention of self and community, referencing the movement and change that is so desired for this nation.<br><br><i>Nothing is Eternal</i> belongs to no one and everyone, a video that moves through the Bay Area and beyond like water, slow and stretched across time. It appears in multiple locations simultaneously or in one for a while. It is, like the rest of us, ungrounded and melancholic and it is, like this time, irresolute. Presented during the 2020 general election, it embodies the contradiction of emotions that pervade our lives, yesterday as much as today, as we head towards an uncertain future. The work posits hope as much as it evinces a sense of mourning. Gibson asks viewers to imagine a destiny beyond our comprehension, on a pathway paved with both tremendous love and immense sorrow.<br><br>The work is as best a response that could be formed to address the violence of institutional timelines, of expectations that remain unreasonable and unsustainable, of a world in crisis, and of living in late capitalism, a train that continues to move with or without its passengers. It is produced through the care and love of many people on each coast, through numerous tears, and under extraordinary, demoralizing conditions. <br><br>Reopening should not be a return.

Walking outside feels like standing downwind from a bonfire, the air hazy and hot, thick with the stench of burning forests. Lightning-sparked blazes around California rage uncontrollably, lives lost, buildings reduced to ashes, natural habitats destroyed. We swap our surgical masks to protect against the global pandemic for thick masks with filters to preserve our lungs.<br><br>I am reminded of Cecilia Vicuña’s <i>Burnt Quipu</i> (2018), wide ribbons of knotted wool dyed the colors of fire, ash, and soot hanging from the ceiling in her exhibition <i>About to Happen</i> at the Berkeley Art Museum two years ago. The installation was a response to the northern California fires that year, but also points to a recurrent theme in Vicuña’s work: the disastrous effects of climate change resulting from reckless human activity. Our best recourse is to coexist with the natural world, as Vicuña, drawing from Indigenous traditions, has been telling us all along. <br><br>For five decades, Vicuña has been making art in the forms of poetry, performance, installations, sculptures, paintings, and street actions that resist capitalism and disrupt colonialism from a feminist perspective. In this present moment, her life work is more pressing than ever.<br><br>(... <a href=\"/on-our-mind/cecilia-vicua-a-is-on-our-mind-2020-2021/introduction-by-jeanne-gerrity\">continue reading</a>).<br>(... <a href=\"/on-our-mind/cecilia-vicua-a-is-on-our-mind-2020-2021/pra%C2%B3logo-por-jeanne-gerrity-traducido-por-juana-berra-o\">sigue leyendo en español</a>).<br><br><br>[image2]<br><br><i>More about the artist</i><br><br>Cecilia Vicuña (b. 1948, Santiago, Chile) is an artist, poet and activist currently based between New York and Santiago.<br><br>Here are additional resources to learn more about her: a <a href=\"/on-our-mind/cecilia-vicua-a-is-on-our-mind-2020-2021/about-cecilia-vicua-a\">biography and exhibition history</a>; excerpts from <a href=\"/on-our-mind/cecilia-vicua-a-is-on-our-mind-2020-2021/on-cecilia-vicua-a-excerpts-from-essays-by-lucy-lippard-juliet-lynd-guisela-latorre-sofa-a-herna-ndez-chong-cuy-miguel-a-la%C2%B3pez-julia-bryan-wilson-daniel-borzutzky\">essays written about her work</a>, some of <a href=\"/on-our-mind/cecilia-vicua-a-is-on-our-mind-2020-2021/in-cecilia-vicua-a-s-own-words\">the artist\'s own words</a>, from written texts and interviews, and a selection of the artist\'s <a href=\"/on-our-mind/cecilia-vicua-a-is-on-our-mind-2020-2021/poems-by-cecilia-vicua-a\">poems</a>. <br><br>Please also visit <a href=\"http://www.ceciliavicuna.com/\" target=\"new\">Vicuña\'s website</a> to find additional images of her objects, paintings, installations, performances, films, and more.<br><br>[image3]<br><br><i>Schedule of Events (September 2020 - July 2021)</i><br><br>On <a href=\"/calendar/monday-september-28-2020\">September 28</a>, the artist and Wattis Curatorial Fellow Jenni Crain hosts a reading group titled <i>Whose footsteps are these?

Minh-ha never really begin nor end. Even though every film begins and ends with an image, and every book begins and ends with a word, her work delivers neither linear successions of events nor settled genealogies of thought. Instead, it invites you into “a stateless and constant form of passage. A passage that is always passing. A shady sort of sovereignty.” (2) We enter somewhere in the middle of things: ensembles of citation, constellations of secondhand memory, piles of objects gathered and given.<br> <br>I want to make a map of passages: <i>I remember only a small part. / But this is what I remember.</i> (3) There is a footpath over the gutter here and the house with the fan palms and the pond with the fish. Over here is where the train stops on its way to the stars. Here is where the boats are docked and where the dwellings are round. Here it is made of paper, and here cellulose, and here chalked onto asphalt. Yes, it is extravagantly colored and hard to hear in places, but it remains no less a map – “the way a fragment of a shattered mirror continues to function as mirror no matter the shape it ends up with.” (4)<br> <br>What is the shape of Trinh’s work? Much of it is concerned with borders, so I’m tempted to imagine an edge: a line between past and present, life and death, tectonic plates and language families. But the edges flicker and emit sparks, and I realize that this flickering is Trinh’s true subject, more so than the edges. “Inter, between, midway: what comes to our senses is always on the go, already in motion,” she has said. (5) Her work is committed (ethically, aesthetically) to honoring the motion that precedes it: the histories of vibration and propulsion, hot molecules lingering in the air.<br> <br>*<br> <br>Close to the beginning of her book <i>Lovecidal</i>, Trinh is already asking, “How to write an ending?”<br> <br>An ending. The last art I saw in person, on a Friday in early March, was an exhibition of paintings at the Met Breuer. It was significant because it was the final exhibition in that space, though I hadn’t been there before. It was also significant because of the artist’s advanced age, and because of its title, <i>Painting After All</i>. In the months since then, the day has assumed in my mind the solemnity of that phrase, its finality. Within a week, the museum would be closed, and I would be putting things in boxes. Soon I’d be pulling all my books from their shelves and posters from their wall.<br> <br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03325.jpeg\'><br><br>In the middle of the gallery, big panes of glass leaned against each other. (6) It wasn’t immediately clear to me why they were there. The rest of the room assembled around this blur, its gravity distorting the dimensions of things. And yet its operation was discreet, silent, transparent. The glass simultaneously yielded to light and threw it around, making images and unmaking them again. It formed a mobile composition of its surroundings: paintings, museumgoers, brick buildings seen through the window. The surface of a city painted with the colors of another. “Each fragment contains the whole, and the world remakes itself anew piece by piece, step by step.” (7) In the middle of the glass, I tried to glimpse that longing for transformation, for “the opposite of misery and hopelessness.” (8)<br> <br>In the next room were six square paintings. Their surfaces bore the signs of some vast scraping, like the sheer face of a glaciated valley. I don’t remember the colors, only that there were colors, infinitely differentiated. I sat on the floor and scribbled some emphatic phrases in my notebook: <i>no clear <u>lines</u>, but seams, edges, patches, directions. there isn’t anything <u>under</u> to <u>uncover</u>.</i> And thought of all the people who would sit there, where I was, and see the same painting and make the same observations. And soon I’d sit again beside a different ocean.<br> <br>*<br> <br>“Again and again, the new normal reaffirms itself to be a state of pending ending,” Trinh writes in <i>Lovecidal</i>. She is referring to the American forever wars that followed 9/11, but the phrase is purposefully allowed to resonate across geographies: “Sudan, Tibet, Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine, Rwanda, Congo, Burma, and … and… and, with the recurring specters of Bosnia, Kosovo, South Africa, Cambodia, Vietnam.”(9) Over the course of the book, she charts an ambulatory course through landscapes of war and neglect. Hers is a mobile cartography, evading occupation even as it chronicles its effects. She quotes Dogen Zenji: “The blue mountains are constantly walking… If you doubt mountains’ walking, you do not know your own walking.” (10)<br> <br>Walking, as a practice, literalizes Trinh’s commitment to the passage, the middle, intervals of beginning and <i>pending ending</i>. Walking takes the body as its reference point: <i>walking pace</i> is a rate of time, <i>walkable</i> a unit of distance. It conjures the polyrhythms of body on earth, step upon breath upon step. And yet it offers, as Walter Benjamin has observed, a vision of cities “without thresholds” and landscapes “in the round.” (11) In <i>Lovecidal</i>, the walker extends from a solitary figure in a landscape to the crowds of the antiwar movement, from tides of displaced people to the “war somnambulists, unaware of their strange and terrifying sleepwalking.” (12)<br><br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03326.jpeg\'><br><br>“She’s not merely going somewhere,” Trinh writes. “Rather, she’s swallowing each step, feeling it with mouth, hand, feet, sole, toe, the whole body in motion, while noticing how thoughts arise, condense, stray, scatter, and return, always ready to concoct stories and even eager to get lost in the process. Now and then, the solitary walk carries her to a strange, collective site: at once emptied from the noises of everyday squabbles and wide open to the call of world events, living intimately abroad at home.” (13)<br> <br>That final sentence is perfectly suited for this particular moment of pending ending: a summer of atomizing worry and common duress, of solitary neighborhood walks and mass street protests. Like Trinh’s walker, I’ve become newly aware of the intimacy and the strangeness of home. Walking as method honors the unruly continuities of the body, rather than the constructed continuities of narrative. Trinh’s work is the product of a lifetime of walking, a lifetime of gathering seeds and sounds in various containers (poetry, theory, documentary, ethnography). (14) Her walking attends to the smallest deposits of material, the warmth and acid of the soil. And it takes place amid generations of displacements, across intimacies of languages and continents. Walking with the disappeared, her sole “conveyance is each morning, breath, departures of any kind, tapers, sheets of anything, paper, cloth, rain, ice, spittle, glass.” (15) She’s not merely going somewhere. <br> <br>*<br> <br>On a map of San Francisco, I saw a place called Mount Olympus that I had never noticed before. It appeared as a tiny patch of green at the end of a single, looping road. The surrounding streets had similarly vertical, atmospheric names: Saturn Street, Upper Terrace, Uranus Terrace, Mars Street. The road there was steep and narrow, and the park, obstructed by surrounding buildings, reveals itself only as you approach its base. Not that it’s much of a park: it’s basically a tiered square. A set of stairs brings from the street you to the second level, which has some benches. Another set of stairs brings to the summit, which is dominated by a large plinth, empty except for a plaque worn by decades of weather.<br> <br> As I was circling the plinth, I saw a man and a woman get off a motorcycle and start to climb the stairs. They approached the plinth, and the man was talking in an indignant tone. “I can’t believe it’s gone,” he said. “This has nothing to do with BLM.”<br> <br>I was pretty sure that nothing like that had happened here. I looked it up on my phone. The statue on the plinth, Triumph of Light, had been donated by Adolph Sutro in 1887. It sat in the center of the city, and depicted the victory of liberty – a woman carrying a torch – over a hulking figure of despotism. “Generations will fade away, and still that monument will Dally in the wind, and scorn the sun,” proclaimed a pamphlet made to commemorate the statue. (16) And while it pierced the ridgeline for decades, it was the statue that would fade away. It was gradually worn away by weather and vandals, and sometime in the 1950s, Triumph of Light dissolved entirely into the overcast. Neither the neighbors nor the city authorities knew where it had gone.<br> <br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03327.jpeg\'><br><br>I told the couple that the statue hadn’t been there since the ‘50s. I felt a little embarrassed to be correcting them. I didn’t feel like I could change anyone’s mind, not really. Still, I showed them a picture of the statue on my phone, and they nodded. Cool right? I said weakly.<br> <br>I’d intended a brief interaction, but I soon found myself engaged in a lengthy conversation – more of a monologue, really – about various low-cost ecommerce platforms. A little wire you would buy for fifty dollars at Best Buy? the man said. You can get that for like thirty cents on Alibaba. This is something he says to everyone he meets. There’s a site for sporting goods too.<br> <br>He said that he was a fifth generation San Franciscan, and waxed nostalgic about decades past, the previous names and faces of the neighborhoods. There’s a lot to know about this place, he said. A lot gets forgotten. For instance, he asked me, have you heard about the plague? The one a hundred years ago? They found these tunnels that started in Chinatown and went down to the bay. They didn’t want anyone to know. (17) There were skeletons there. Plague bones, he said. Did you hear about that? Down by the water, that’s where they stayed.<br> <br>*<br> <br>Trinh’s work, no matter its medium, refuses the total triumph of light. It instead assumes the form of a twilight walk. “Clarity,” she writes in <i>Woman, Native, Other</i>, “is a means of subjection, a quality both of official, taught language and of correct writing, two old mates of power: together they flower, together they flower, vertically, to impose an order.” (18)<br> <br>Her body of work repeatedly enacts this distrust of the well-spoken and the high-resolution. She is uninterested in locating a perfect language for feminism or Third World struggle or visual anthropology. She attends, instead, to the disjuncture of the language that we have: the repetitions and silences, jump-cuts and black-outs, and what she calls “holes in the sound wall.” (19) Her work is animated by a “choppy, broken voice” that can rarely be heard from beginning to end. (20) This voice is compromised by its arduous travel between virtual and material, analog and digital, continent and footfall and continent. This is language as “a gift, a theft, an excess or waste, made between Skopje and Saigon by interns and non-resident aliens on Emoji keyboards.” (21) These are voices “marooned in music, dark nightclubs of weeping, in never-sufficient verses, uncommunicated sentences, strict tears, in copper throats.” (22) <br> <br>Trinh’s work is a place for stories to collide: escape stories and ice stories, slept stories and swarm stories, <i>semblance of noise</i> stories and <i>never been born</i> stories. (23) Her citational practice refuses to impose an artificial unity; it suggests the possibility of coalition, rather than determining its parameters in advance. She allows her interlocutors’ words to take up space on the page. She allows their questions to resonate, remain unanswered. She allows them passage.<br> <br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03328.jpeg\'><br><br>In <i>Lovecidal</i>, for instance, she quotes Trần Thái Tông: “By what road / does the scent of cinnamon flowers / come to us at the end of the day?” (24)<br> <br>Trinh’s walker echoes the phrase: “What makes a man bomb a flower? By what road did a green plant come to the onlooker as an enemy?”<br> <br>And she wonders: “In what tongues do rain and wind speak? In what keys do they sing?”<br> <br>Pablo Neruda puts it slightly differently: “In what language does rain fall / over tormented cities? / At dawn, which smooth syllables / does the ocean air repeat?” (25)<br> <br>*<br> <br>A few weeks ago, I was sitting on a bench near Fort Mason, looking out onto the water, eating a sandwich. A woman biked up to another bench nearby. A bouquet of slightly wilted flowers lay in her basket. She picked them up, one by one, and started throwing them into the ocean. The gesture seemed to have some private significance, so I didn’t look at her. I looked instead at the water as it was briefly punctured, just as the air had been, by color. I wondered, briefly, what it meant, what the ocean had taken and why it kept taking.<br> <br>After a while, to my surprise, the woman came over to my bench and asked me if I wanted to throw some flowers. It’s fun, she said. They go surprisingly far. She handed me one, and I watched her throw another, observing her technique. The flowers were heavy enough on one end – dense enough with petal, stigma, style – to spin through the sky like tiny divers. I held the stem and released, watching it go.<br> <br>I felt the place in my hand where the stem had been. The stranger reached over to hand me some more flowers.

For five decades, she has been making art in the forms of poetry, performance, installations, sculptures, paintings, and street actions that resist capitalism and disrupt colonialism from a feminist perspective.<br><br>[image1]<br><br>In Chile, Vicuña began to develop a body of work that largely exists through precarious, impermanent gestures —  their degradation, disappearance, and experiential impact communicate an intention to illuminate, preserve and pay tribute to indigenous history and practice, and also to the natural world. In doing so, Vicuña draws attention to the urgent side effects of modernity, wherein essentialist command has bred widespread violations of the environment, of human rights, and of cultural traditions. <br><br>In 1967, Vicuña and five peers founded the Tribu No. Their intent, as demonstrated by the ‘No Manifesto of the No Tribe,’ was to “undermine society from within” through subversion and through loving, and to “leave humans naked, without preconceived notions. Without conventional attachments/attire.” “As long as life’s magnificence persists in our solitary yet connected experiences, nothing worries us,” they shared. And thus, through writing, drawing, painting, playing, performing, improvising the group sought to destabilize conservative, canonical and authoritative governance forced upon the world.<br><br>In 1972, Vicuña relocated to the United Kingdom for postgraduate studies at Slade School of Fine Art, University College London. Following the violent coup against President Allende in 1973, Vicuña decided to stay in London until 1975 when she relocated to Bogotá, Colombia. The works that she developed in London and Bogotá, in isolation from her native country, as well as in New York, where she relocated in 1980, and also into the future, became mediations of protest and of pedagogy, exploring the possibilities of connection, imagination, and liberation in rethinking one’s navigation of terrains of the everyday.<br><br>[image2]<br><br>A retrospective exhibition, <i>Cecilia Vicuña: Seehearing the Enlightened Failure</i>, which includes of over one hundred works and materials related to the artist’s oeuvre, is on view through October 25, 2020 at the Museo Universitario Arte Contemporáneo (MUAC) in Mexico City.

Her art is not easily categorized. She’s neither a poet who makes art, nor an artist who writes poetry. Her art is a naturally fused amalgamation of word and act in which she not only translates but becomes an archaeologist of language – excavating, dissecting, recreating meaning and communicating it to the inhabitants of today.”<br><br>- Lucy Lippard, “Floating Between Past and Future: The Indigenisation of Environmental Politics” (2017)<br><br>[image1]<br><br>“...her precarious aesthetics avoids imposing any one interpretation on the past (or on contemporary indigenous cultures as alternative communities); instead, it utilizes the exoticism of indigenous aesthetics to trigger the imagination and invite the possibility of forging a utopian alternative to the social hierarchies constructed throughout the Americas as a result of colonialism as well as of dictatorship and contemporary neoliberal globalization. <br><br>The precarious aesthetic is for Vicuña the vehicle for attaining an open-ended mode of representation that denies fixed meanings and privileges creative connections, positioning the ephemeral as a gesture of hope against hegemonic discourses of power.”<br><br>- Juliet Lynd, “Precarious Resistance: Weaving Opposition in the Poetry of Cecilia Vicuña” (2005)<br><br>[image2]<br><br>“For Vicuña, making precarious art means remaining mindful and compassionate in one’s creative practice. Reflecting deeply and thoughtfully on precarity, however, also means denouncing the social structures of oppression and inequality that endanger and threaten not only human beings, but also our democracies and ecosystems. Precarity, as seen in Vicuña’s art, is both a natural and unnatural phenomenon that can be generative and devastating at the same time.”<br><br>- Guisela Latorre, “Cecilia Vicuña’s Precarious Universe” (2019)<br><br>[image3]<br><br>“Her work would in many ways be both triggered and inspired by political resistance. Political causes would also be addressed in more micro-political ways. Feminist and sociological methods, as well as indigenous culture and natural materials, would imbue her practice. The result would see her develop a varied and multidisciplinary body of work, which at times relies on words, images, environments, and a combination of languages, mediums, and techniques. But even while having an active practice in the arts, it has only been the last couple of years that Vicuña’s work has garnered more attention. Contributing to this is, in part, the ongoing feminist revisionism of art history, as well as the wider comprehension of indigenous forms of knowledge, which her work tacitly conveys.”<br><br>- Sofía Hernández Chong Cuy, Foreword, <i>Cecilia Vicuña: Seehearing the Enlightened Failure</i> (2019)<br><br>[image4]<br><br>“Her work ‘is responding to a sign, it is not imposing a mark. Being a ‘non-site’ piece, it is not about appearance, but about disappearance.’<br><br>Vicuña valued the ritual, medicinal, healing, or shamanic aspect of art whose function is not to colonize or possess but to <i>foster</i> modifications in structures at both microscopic (non-visible phenomena) and macroscopic (perceptible physical experiences) levels. Her cyclical understanding of the creative act is conveyed through the return of ideals that do not exist as ‘final objects’ but as rehearsals – like the <i>precarios </i> or quipus that she has been recreating since 1966. Her weavings and assemblages seem to activate a memory of ancient civilizations. The strands of hair, strings, and vegetable and mineral debris that she incorporates into her works evoke indigenous settlements, Andean <i>wak’as</i> (sanctuaries, idols, temples, and graves), and the remains of original native peoples that reveal aspects of indigenous ontologies and other formations of the sacred that challenge Western ideas about time – in Andean philosophy the past and the present are part of a single non-evolutionary and non-determinist temporal concept based on circuvolutions or loops called <i>pacha</i>. <br><br>Her use of found materials – what she calls <i>basuritas</i> [little rubbish, little garbage] – is a way to stress the possibility of unearthing the meanings and power of things that are marked as disposable by the frenzied logic of the consumer society and the profit motive.”<br><br>- Miguel A. López, “Cecilia Vicuña: A Retrospective For Eyes That Do Not See” (2019)<br><br>[image5]<br><br>“Words are part of Vicuña’s weaving vortex, as in spinning a tale or a poem or a spell–<i>Palabrarmas</i> or ‘wordweapons.’ She continues to dissect words, uncovering their skeletons and renaming their components, opening them up ‘so that their internal metaphors were exposed, so people would see words not just as abstractions but as something very concrete.’...This is also her method in the sculptural <i>precarios</i>. Sometimes they are very simple, haikus from nature, as in <i>Tremo</i>, which is made of wood, bone, wood, bone, wood, bone. Sometimes the materials are put together only to transform into something else — a boat, a web, a tree of life — identifying with her materials and their histories of freedom, use, or misery.” <br><br>- Lucy Lippard, “Spinning the Common Thread” (1997)<br><br>[image6]<br><br>“By leaving her materials somewhat unworked, such as wool fleece and unspun wool roving, Vicuña goes back to the initial stages of textile creaton, using what I term preconstruction to recall histories of shearing and gathering as well as to gesture toward these materials’ futurities and afterlives as they propose themselves as the incipient materials of production, ready to be spun and woven. Deliberately unfinished, or even, in the case of <i>Quipu in the Gutter</i>, drawing attention to procedures of unraveling and unweaving, they refuse to be fully transformed into polished commodities. They ignite thought about what is to come, asking what sorts of factories and what sorts of working conditions might be put to use in the service of their reanimation, suggesting the nascent, the about to happen, the almost, the gearing up. As she writes about her attraction to unspun wool, ‘It’s no thing / it’s pure potential.’ Such materials also imply a halting of a process, the arresting of some future instrumentalization, as when stones weigh down a length of white wool, making it inert and unusable for any functional purpose–harking back to work stoppages, strikes, and, as with the Yarur mill, reclamation.”<br><br>- Julia Bryan-Wilson, “Threads of Protest” in <i>Fray: Art and Textile Politics</i> (2017)<br><br>[image7]<br><br>“Dictatorships violently clarify ambiguities. As an exile, as a feminist, as a person who lost friends and family members to the military dictatorship, as a person who lost her country because of the military dictatorship, as someone who has always acknowledged and vehemently supported the dissemination of indigenous art, as an observer of U.S. culture, as someone out of place in two countries — Chile and the U.S., where she has lived for over 30 years — and as a member of no nation, Vicuña has always constructed her work from a position of resistance: to fascist government, to social hierarchies, to corporate power structures, to sexist power structures, to good taste, to the fashions of even the experimental art world. She is a poet, a performer, a visual artist, an anthologist, and among other things, a radical archivist. In the process, though, she is a model of how one lives her life in the struggles of art and politics through presence, through resilience, through continuous innovation, through a relentless questioning of history and tradition, through an idealism that is not naive, an idealism that understands how bad the world is, an idealism which believes that we need art to report horrors, to explain the horrors, to critique the horrors; we need art about the horrors to make our own horrible lives a little bit more worth living.”<br><br>- Daniel Borzutzky, “No, No and No: The Art of Cecilia Vicuña” (2018)<br>',''),(1116,1,'2020-09-04 04:07:43','2020-09-12 02:35:15',NULL,'In <a href=\'/on-our-mind/cecilia-vicua-a-is-on-our-mind-2020-2021\'>Cecilia VicuÃ±a\'s</a> own words\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'in-cecilia-vicua-a-s-own-words',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',_binary 'Scroll down to read, or select the following links to go directly to a specific text:<br><br>An <a href=\"#Flores\">interview with Tatiana Flores</a>, 2009<br><br>An <a href=\"#Kan\">interview with Elianna Kan</a>, 2019<br><br><a href=\"#Vicuna\">“PAIN THINGS & EXPLANATIONS: pain tings & ex”</a>, May 1973<br><br>[image1]<br><br><a name=\"Flores\">An Interview with Tatiana Flores, Assistant Professor, Department of Art History, Rutgers</a> (2009) (excerpt)<br> <br>TF: The exhibition of your work at Rutgers is structured as a retrospective, and it includes a compendium of your visual production from the 1960s to the present. People who are familiar with your poetry and performance may be surprised to find that you were once a painter. Could you please discuss this early work: how it came about, who are your subjects, and why did you stop painting?<br> <br>CV: ...The idea in these paintings was to reflect the way in which the colonists forced the indiginous to work in the churches and monasteries creating imitations of European artists. But the indigenous managed to transform those images, creating different versions: Pachamama as a mountain with the head of a Virgin. For a period of ten years I painted in the colonial style to express the fact that five hundred years later we, as Latin Americans, were still under colonial domination. People still had to think in terms of the Western world-view no matter how foreign this was to us.<br> <br>TF: In 1971 you held a solo exhibition at the Museo Nacional Bellas Artes in Santiago, the <i>Salón de Otoño (Autumn Salon)</i>. It consisted of filling the galleries with bags of dead leaves, and you referred to it as a contribution to socialism in Chile. I am curious to understand your thought process and the context better. Would you please describe the significance of the dead leaves? How did you reconcile this work, referred to by the curator as “conceptual art,” a term that had previously been unfamiliar to you with your painting? And how did you envision socialism in Chile?<br> <br>CV: Well, first of all, I don’t think the art of the otoño piece and the paintings can be reconciled. They are actually mortal enemies. They are at odds with each other because painting, as I said, is a colonial European art. I was fully conscious of this and was acting the slave. On the other hand, the autumn piece was coming from the complete freedom of my indigenous side. It is an art of dissolution as renewal, the core of my precarious work. Truly, I had no exposure to conceptual art; I didn’t know about it, but the curator, Nemesio Antunez, had recently been in New York where he saw conceptual art. Actually, I heard the term the first time when he mentioned it. I wasn’t aware of the latest trends; I didn’t have that kind of orientation. I looked at art historical books that traced art all the way back to the Paleolithic. I had a good idea of what art was and intuited that the next thing, what needed to be done was to continue the art that was interrupted by colonialism. This meant to focus again, as ancient people did, on the life cycle.<br> <br>TF: And how was this a contribution to socialism?<br> <br>CV: Socialism was interpreted as another European invention and the Socialist Movement in Chile was anti-indigenous, like most social movements in Latin-America have been. But I was a child of the 60s and Ernesto Cardenal’s writings were already there. Great anthologies of indigenous poetry had been published in Mexico, in Paraguay, in Argentina so I was exposed to indigenous thinking very early. I knew this was the real revolution: to pay attention to what our excluded side had to say about the connection of human beings to the cosmos, to the earth, to the life force itself.<br> <br>TF: ...you mentioned that socialism was Eurocentric and that there was not too much consciousness of the indigenous during that time.<br> <br>CV: Very little. Nevertheless, Allende is historically the only government in Chile that gave rights to the indigenous people. Of course these were revoked with Pinochet. Allende believed that the indigenous people needed to have their rights, but there wasn’t an awareness in Chilean society. Even today, you have very few artists in Chile who are really sympathetic with the struggle happening today. The indigenous people of Chile are in big trouble because of globalization. Lands are being taken for mining, for forest destruction, for all kinds of polluting industries that disregard completely any kind of human right, or civil right, or cultural right.<br> <br>TF: The 1960s and 70s were remarkable in that there still existed the optimistic, or possibly utopian, notion that art could contribute to social change...would you advocate for a more activist posture for younger artists?<br> <br>CV: ...I inherited an idealistic view, both from my European and my indiginous side, that art was a way of interacting with the life force. Because art is a way of getting deeper into the question of how perception works; how observation affects what is observed. Now, through quantum physics, you can see that the ancient view of the indigenous, and some European traditions, were grounded in an understanding now proven as completely real. The practice of art affects the body, nature, and everything else. What the present moment calls for is awareness of the effects of our actions.<br><br>[...]<br><br>CV: ...we are exhausting the earth at this moment. We are working very hard to self-destruct. So the only way out is to remember who we really are. Humanness arose from empathy. We can put ourselves in the shoes of the other. This is true humanity, and we have forgotten that, and when you relate to nature you have to be in interaction with nature, which teaches you that. Because the cycle of life and death includes everybody, starting with the air you breathe, starting with your shit, with your food. So I think that we, as human beings, are moving towards a memory of the future that involves a reconnection with the past.<br> <br>TF: Lastly, I am curious to know more about your relation to feminism.<br> <br>CV: I remember the moment when I heard the word “feminism” for the first time. Sometime in the early 60s I thought it was the most wonderful thing in the world. At that time, women were burning their bras and there was a huge movement happening in the northern hemisphere while Chile was impervious to it…I was a little disappointed when I arrived in London in 1972 and attended a conference and found feminism had been reduced to a political issue. I thought, “My God… I thought feminism was meant to change humanity and the way people live on this planet.” I have stuck with that feeling, therefore, I have always been a feminist...Right now feminism seems to be dormant. I see people thinking that it belongs in the past, but for me it belongs in the future. Its true form has not yet unfolded. When it does it will change the lives of everybody, not just women. Maybe it will have a new name, but if both men and women were to embrace the feminine within, admit to our vulnerability, then a new human culture would arise.<br><br>[image2]<br><br><a name=\"Kan\">An Interview with Elianna Kan for BOMB Magazine,</a> 2019 (excerpt)<br> <br>EK: What is the relationship between these different languages you inhabit? <br> <br>CV: My work is really multilingual, and it includes languages I don’t even know myself – meaning languages I feel. I sense they exist because I hear them as a murmur, a sound, a concept. They’re unknown. They may have existed already, or maybe they will in the future. <br> <br>I work mostly, of course, in Spanish, my native lung – or tongue. And because I’ve been in the U.S. for so long, there’s English too. Also, I always include the presence of other languages, like Mapudungun, Guarini, Ouecha, and Aymara. These come across as containers for a philosophy of how language works. They cannot be translated. So, you will find in my <i>New and Selected Poems</i> (Kelsey Street Press, 2018) many different languages – including Greek, Latin, and other ancient tongues as components of contemporary ones. <br> <br>EK: What are these philosophies of language evoked or generated by the indigenous languages of South America?<br> <br>CV: In the west, the idea that only the Greeks had philosophy and that inidigenous peoples didn’t (and still don’t) is very prevalent. The philosophy of ancient peoples is always included in the composition of their language – the phrases, syntax, and relationship between what you say and what you don’t. For example, in Quechua there’s such precision to an expression: somebody did something. You have to include in the word whether you heard it, witnessed it or heard it from someone else who witnessed it, and so forth. There are all these specific determinants. So the fact that such expressions have to be as precise as possible and at the same time suggestive of other dimensions is included in the creation of the language as a masterpiece – an artwork. <br> <br>You can find this Mapudungun too – the language of the Mapuche people in the south of Chile. In 1998, I edited an anthology of Mapudungun poetry. Their philosophy of language includes an awareness of three types: the language people speak among one another, the one they speak with nature, and the one used to speak to another dimension, to those who are gone – ancestors, or even, future people. <br> <br>EK: This seems to be more than a philosophy of language; it’s a metaphysics. These modes of communication grant that the human use of language involves nature and the physical world, communion with others and beyond. <br> <br>CV: For instance, right now I’m a passionate student of quantum physics. Scientists are investigating the existence of a state where a molecule knows it’s being observed and changes in response. I might conceive of language the same way: it changes when you relate to it with an awareness of what you are seeing or engaging in, within that exchange, as if language were an alternate reality. <br> <br>EK: When you mention Greek philosophy, I think of argumentative language deployed for the sake of making a case to convince another. But you use language in many other ways. <br> <br>CV: The perception you just described is what is taught in the academy. Later Greek culture, after the classic era – meaning after male takeover, when patriarchy really sets in – becomes an instrument for domination, where clarity really means ruling. But any of the roots and etymologies of ancient Greek reflect an earlier culture of female creativity, as is the case the world over. The testimony to that is inside the words themselves. It’s a fact that very few languages speak of thought without involving weaving. I’ve been working to dig out all these weaving metaphors because they’ve become invisible. People say, “Oh, I’ve lost the thread of my thought.” Why is that, and who created that metaphor? Was it a weaver?<br> <br>EK: And weavers tended to be women, presumably. <br> <br>CV: Across the world! In the teaching of language, there’s this <i>invisibilization</i> of women, even though the words themselves speak otherwise. <br> <br>EK: They betray a pre-patriarchal past. <br> <br>CV: Yeah, and that’s the content of my work.<br><br>[...]  <br><br>EK: This notion of ownership and creativity reminds me of the way we speak about translation in terms of fidelity and infidelity, as if it’s clear what would be one or the other. There’s anxiety about an essential original. <br> <br>CV: This may be a function of private property, even of owning the body of a woman, of the right to rule over others. There’s definitely a hang-up with ownership. You hear artists and poets speak of “my work.” Even I say it. People ask about “your work,” in those terms. But I think <i>my</i> or <i>your</i> is relative because what’s really happening is always an interaction. You can own that interaction maybe, but it will always be changing. There’s a permanent impermanence to that relationship.<br> <br>E: Speaking of relationships, temporal and emotional, how do you relate to memory? And how is it explored in your work?<br> <br>CV: Memory is a great mystery. Physicists have discovered that a particle has a memory of its trajectory, of where it has been. What does that tell you about living cells, about land? These are notions indigenous people have expressed for so long – like that a rock has memory. Now medical science is recognizing that a fetus carries an epigenetic memory, transmitted from the mother. Her likes and dislikes, emotions and pain, all influence the epigenetic make-up of the child. Our ancestors’ trauma and memories are passed down to us, influencing how we see the world and tell stories. This notion is being expanded by science and also by the awakening of the human spirit. We have this reduction of the human imagination due to the invasion of technology, but at the same time, through our interactions, there’s this awakening. Which force will take over, which will humanity follow? Do we move toward total destruction and loss, or to the recovery of the spirit? Memory, I think, is the foundation of the future – not as preservation but as creativity. <br><br>[image3]<br><br><a name=\"Vicuna\">Cecilia Vicuña, “PAIN THINGS & EXPLANATIONS: pain tings & ex,”</a> May 1973<br> <br>The real explanations of my paintings are lost in santiago. <br> <br>I regard my act of painting as ritual. Any objects that this activity produces exist beyond art history, as if art history was already dead or it would have never existed. In my paintings I need every form to irritate, disgust, or disturb. They issue from a convulsed state in which images, helix forms moving as propellers, force their way out. What are those images I yearn to capture in a poem, a pain ting, a conversation or a concept thing? I want to use them as vehicles from inner into outer space & from outer into inner space, because they can lead me to a state of joy & revelation. These forms come from a specific place & they go to another equally specific place. When I paint the certainty of being in a centre is so deep that makes the back of my head ache. I am within a raw flesh heart and need my painting to provoke and be the raw flesh itself. <br><br>I am slowly getting closer to a form. To find it I need an opener and then a needle to join the loose ends into a structure that is not only a diagram, a spiders web in the cosmos or a mandala but a particular universe to be used by the thinker. It could be said that thought functions by creating diagrams in which each point is used only as a reference for movement within the unlimited. The thinker pretends that these references are fixed so that he can establish certain particularities as unalterable truths, arbitrarily chosen. Thus immovability within movement is created and along with it the Illusion of Order and Time. <br><br>In thinking of the forms for which I am looking I can’t help but find other forms for things outside my paintings, for any search must associate and connect with the search for a social ebay. If not it is a castrated search, an apolitical occupation good for nothing, or good to help maintain the present structures which have been established for the benefit of the few and the destruction of the rest. <br><br>But now these structures must be established taking into consideration facts other than profit or power. It will be possible to simplify these facts to these three categories:<br>- The way in & out of air in the lungs<br>- The way in & out of the food<br>- The way in of the semen and the way out in the shape of a child. <br>This is the elemental spider-web. The only structure loved by the planet, the only one that has a right to be sustained upon the others because it can be called wise or good for life. <br><br>The search for a structure in society is analogist to the search I undertake for form in my works. The social form is easier to find, it’s obviously socialism, self sufficient communities, but is harder to do it. The form I search for is harder to find, but easier to do. <br><br>The findings of paradise will coincide <br>with the finding of a language. <br> <br>(paintings coming out of darkness go back to darkness. automatic images issur from “regiones eqivas’, evading regions, and right after exposure, like dreams, they return to their burrows in accessible places. all my work comes from stupidity and nausea. paintings coming from these feelings seem to change and establish an appearance and dialogue unique to the observer; just as the fairy tale mirrors.)<br> ',''),(1117,1,'2020-09-04 04:09:19','2020-09-11 19:28:28',NULL,'Poems by <a href=\'/on-our-mind/cecilia-vicua-a-is-on-our-mind-2020-2021\'>Cecilia VicuÃ±a</a>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'poems-by-cecilia-vicua-a',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',_binary '[image1]<br><br>[image2]<br><br>[image3]<br><br>[image4]<br><br>[image5]<br><br>[image6]',''),(1118,1,'2020-09-04 20:53:44','2020-09-14 18:25:35',NULL,'Introduction\r\nby Jeanne Gerrity',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'introduction-by-jeanne-gerrity',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',_binary 'I’m writing this text from San Francisco in August of 2020. Walking outside feels like standing downwind from a bonfire, the air hazy and hot, thick with the stench of burning forests. Lightning-sparked blazes around California rage uncontrollably, lives lost, buildings reduced to ashes, natural habitats destroyed. We swap our surgical masks to protect against the global pandemic for thick masks with filters to preserve our lungs.<br><br>[image1]<br><br>I am reminded of <a href=\'/on-our-mind/cecilia-vicua-a-is-on-our-mind-2020-2021\'>Cecilia Vicuña’s</a> <i>Burnt Quipu</i> (2018), wide ribbons of wool dyed the colors of fire, ash, and soot hanging from the ceiling in her exhibition <i>About to Happen</i> at the Berkeley Art Museum two years ago. The installation was a response to the northern California fires that year, but also points to a recurrent theme in Vicuña’s work: the disastrous effects of climate change resulting from reckless human activity. [1] Our best recourse is to coexist with the natural world, as Indigenous traditions have been telling us all along, and Vicuña draws from these ancient concepts to help spread this message.  <br><blockquote><i>We propose to slow down fast, a toda raja, before it is too late, before the nauseating speeding up of (our) destructiveness kills us all. We can perform it daily and the awareness that others are doing it too will come.<br><br>Tune into la raja, the tear, the rip, the opening, the slit between your legs—to take its pulse. Slide out of time and into the cosmic current. Wiggle loose from the grip of worldview based on monetary currency and colonial oppression and swim the laps of what we really are, Indigenous to the universe.</i> <br>(Camila Marambio & Cecilia Vicuña, 2018)</blockquote><br>For five decades Cecilia Vicuña (b. 1948, Santiago de Chile) has been making art in the forms of poetry, performance, installations, sculptures, paintings, and street actions that resist capitalism and disrupt colonialism from a feminist perspective. In this present moment her life’s work is more pressing than ever.<br><blockquote><i>Joy could make people aware of the need to fight for joy. The urgency of the present is the urgency for revolution.</i> (Cecilia Vicuña, 1973)</blockquote><br>[image2]<br><br>In 1973 Augusto Pinochet’s military coup overthrew Chilean president Salvador Allende and upended the promise of a socialist future for Chile, which devolved instead into the horror of a totalitarian dictatorship. Vicuña was studying abroad in London at the time and was profoundly affected by this political catastrophe. She was working on <i>Sabor a mi</i> (1973), her first book of erotic, feminist poems, which she quickly reimagined as a manifesto against the coup, and her faux-naive paintings of the 1970s, which featured subject matter traversing Fidel Castro, queer love, and protest marches. Art and politics became indelibly intertwined and, ever since, she has worked to counter despair with energetic resolve. <br><br>Vicuña rejects the notion that poetry is elite and erudite, removing it from the academy and taking it to the streets. In the performance <i>Vaso de Leche/Glass of Milk</i> (1979), she spilled a glass of “milk” (white paint) on a sidewalk in Bogotá, Colombia, and wrote a poem on the pavement in order to draw attention to the crime committed by local merchants of adding paint to milk to increase profits, which resulted in the death of 1,920 children and no action taken by the government. With her 1980 documentary <i>What is Poetry to You?</i>, which poses the titular question to a cross section of residents of Bogotá from mechanics to sex workers to university students, she asserts that art and poetry do not belong only to the upper class. Vicuña refuses to patronize her intended audience of ordinary citizens; her work is resolutely complex and conceptual. <br><br>[image3] <br><br><i>Palabrarmas</i> is a neologism that translates to “word weapons” or “word arms.” Vicuña’s riddles are clever word plays turned into literal protest signs meant to provoke global action. The word Verdad (truth) unravels to become <i>dar ver</i> (to give sight), and <i>pala</i> (shovel) emerges from <i>palabra</i> (word) to reveal a physical implement or potential weapon within text. Created in the late 1960s and 1970s, Vicuña’s <i>Palabrarmas</i> boldly posit that language can fight violence during a time of rampant corruption and gruesome crime. She had originally called them divinations as a way to denote their spiritual connection, and these invented phrases use language in concert with visual art as both an intellectual tool and a mystical force. The symbolic power of language is evident today in recent Black Lives Matters protests—the slogan itself painted large on vacant downtown streets and across boarded up buildings to show solidarity with the movement, and walls tagged with poetic lines and quotations from people like Martin Luther King Jr and Nelson Mandela.  <br><br>[image4] <br><blockquote><i>Words want to speak; to listen to them is the first task.</i> (Cecilia Vicuña, 1984)</blockquote><br>Vicuña’s own poetry readings are memorable events that blend ritual and intellect. Channeling a shaman, she chants in Spanish, English, and dialects indigenous to Latin America, such as Quechua and Mapuche, alternating languages in order to destroy the hegemony of English. She encircles rapt audience members with red yarn, wending her way to the front of the room. Vicuña consistently disregards boundaries between mediums, refusing to fit neatly within predetermined categories of a commercial western art world. Readings morph into performances. Poetry becomes protest signs. Sculptures are absorbed by the sea. <br><blockquote><i>The sun spins the thread of life around the world the earth is a loom and the sun weaves the night and day</i> (Cecilia Vicuña, 1997)</blockquote><br>When we meet she tells me that the <i>Tao Te Ching</i>, the foundational text of Taoism, has had a profound effect on her: “Abiding in the ancient Way/ To master what has now come to be/ And fathom its ancient source: This is called <i>thread of the Way.</i>” I can see how this emphasis on the harmony of the productive forces of the cosmos resonates with Vicuña’s own deference to earlier cultures, and the concept of thread as a connective force is a tool and a metaphor that runs throughout her work. Vicuña’s threads are woven from wool and other organic fibers that have a long aesthetic and utilitarian history. <br><br>[image5]<br><br>Her immersive installations of enveloping skeins of soft wool pay homage to quipus, an intricate system of knotted cords used by pre-Columbian cultures for accounting and record keeping. Devices that existed before language, quipus employed textile for its symbolic power and lightness. Quipus traveled as encoded messages carried by runners (<i>chaskis</i>) across the entire Inka universe from Ecuador to Chile. The Indigenous quipus were presumably intended to transmit memory, and yet their original purpose is not completely known. Embracing the uncertainties surrounding the quipus, Vicuña’s installations evoke these eponymous Andean knowledge systems destroyed by colonial regimes, engaging with their themes of dissolution, erasure, and misinterpretation. She is unafraid of the feminist association with textile art, and her quipus are often dyed blood red to assert a matriarchal primacy linked to menstruation. This embrace of the color red continues Vicuña’s celebration of the female body that began with her defiantly feminist painting <i>Angel of Menstruation</i> (1973).<br><br>[image6]<br><br>“Presence gives things their value, but absence makes them work,” reads the <i>Tao Te Ching</i>. Vicuña’s <i>precarios</i>, small, found object sculptures composed of natural elements and plastic debris, express an acceptance of the ephemeral nature of things. They resist preservation, intended to degrade over time. Vicuña did not consider her first <i>precario</i>, created on the beach in Chile in 1966, to be complete until it was swept out with the tide. Since then, she has constructed hundreds of these fragile sculptures, often near bodies of water and frequently outdoors. They conjoin quotidian objects in surprising and revelatory juxtapositions that she calls “metaphors in space.” <br><br>[image7]<br><br>Crafted from organic materials such as twigs, feathers, and leaves, and man-made detritus like cloth scraps, string, and pieces of electronics, the <i>precarios</i> commune with nature without submitting it to violence. They reflect environmental degradation, but they also engage with the idea of disappearance, and in particular the disappearance of Indigenous people. Vicuña sometimes refers to the <i>precarios</i> as “basuritas,” or “little trash,” a literal reference to the cast-off materials that form these exquisite sculptures, but also to her own feeling of being treated as trash in the mainstream western art world as a Latin American artist and a woman. The <i>precarios</i> seem to acknowledge that a significant portion of the world’s population, in particular BIPOC women, exists in a state of precarity in the era of patriarchal, global capitalism.<br><br>[image8]<br><blockquote>“The Sleeping Gypsy (A Lion Guards Her Dream Journal)”<br><br><i>The Gypsy has been writing for many years <br>a secret text no one will ever<br>read, but which has begun<br>to materialize in real life.<br><br>While she continues dreaming<br>her dreams create the world.<br><br>The lion, however, <br>cannot sleep.<br>If he ceases to watch her,<br>she could awaken <br>and we vanish <br>instantly.</i><br>(Cecilia Vicuña, 1966–71)</blockquote><br>If Vicuña is the protagonist in this poem, then her premonition has come to fruition: the secret text has begun to materialize in real life. In the fall of 2019, Chile experienced a national uprising to demand change. Enraged and mobilized by the economic inequality rampant in the country, Chileans took to the street in protest. During a studio visit, she tells me that young women in Santiago recently remade her <i>Palabrarmas</i> posters and used red thread as part of their actions during the resistance movement. <br><br>Vicuña’s work is, and has always been, prescient and urgent. She reaches back in time to find ancestral truths buried by colonial histories. Even the solution to the wildfires raging across California may be a simple one rooted in Indigenous practices remembered by only a few. [2] In contrast to the hubris of the art world and the greed of neoliberalism, Vicuña taps into deep connections between humankind and nature to express the precarity of our existence. <br><br>As the world goes up in flames around us, quite literally, living in a state of precarity has become the norm rather than the exception. In California, the unemployment rate rose to 18.2% in July, up from 3.9% in January. Along with the sudden loss of jobs comes a huge increase in homelessness and food insecurity. Public schools in the state haven’t been open for six months. Around the country the police are murdering Black people, and a fascist president is dividing the country. Faced with these horrors we find ourselves asking: What role does art play in revolution? Can art make a difference? How can we use art as a tool to better understand the world and ourselves? Is art ever enough? We approach these questions through the lens of Cecilia Vicuña, whose work grapples with themes related to the turmoil (and glimmers of hope) of our present moment.<br><br><i>While she continues dreaming, her dreams create the world.</i><br><br><br>Notes:<br>[1] Recently the intimate relationship between the spread of infectious diseases and climate change has also become terrifyingly clear. <a href = \'https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/c-change/subtopics/coronavirus-and-climate-change/ \' target= \'new\'>https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/c-change/subtopics/coronavirus-and-climate-change/</a><br>[2] <a href = \'https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/us/native-american-controlled-burns-california-wildfires.html<br> \' target= \'new\'>https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/us/native-american-controlled-burns-california-wildfires.html</a><br>',''),(1119,1,'2020-09-05 00:46:02','2020-10-30 08:12:06',NULL,'Gibson',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'gibson',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',_binary 'Launching online on October 30: a new video by <a href = \'/calendar/thursday-october-22-2020\'>Jeffrey Gibson</a>.',''),(1120,1,'2020-09-09 21:28:15','2020-12-27 21:54:52',366,'Wednesday, October 21, 2020',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'wednesday-october-21-2020',NULL,'2020-10-21 16:00:00','2020-10-21 17:00:00',NULL,NULL,_binary '...Joshua Myers: <I>The Black Radical Tradition; or a Poetics of a Liberation</I>',_binary '<I>Many of us have been forced to bear witness to the anti-Black foundation of our world for the first time.

Salir a caminar se siente como ir en contra del viento de una hoguera. El aire es brumoso y caliente, espeso con el hedor de los bosques en llamas. Varios incendios provocados por tormentas de relámpagos arden de manera incontrolable alrededor de California.

Reemplazamos las mascarillas quirúrgicas que nos protegen contra la pandemia mundial por mascarillas gruesas con filtros especiales para cuidar nuestros pulmones.<br><br>[image1]<br><br>Me viene a la mente <i>Quipu Quemado (Burnt Quipu)</i> de <a href=\'/on-our-mind/cecilia-vicua-a-is-on-our-mind-2020-2021\'>Cecilia Vicuña</a> (2018). Anchos cordones de lana anudados y teñidos con los colores del fuego, de la ceniza y del hollín colgaban del techo en su exposición <i>A Punto de Suceder (About to Happen)</i > presentada en el Museo de Arte de Berkeley (Berkeley Art Museum) hace dos años. Aunque esta instalación fue hecha en respuesta a los incendios que sucedieron en el norte de California ese año, también hace alusión a un tema recurrente en el trabajo de Vicuña: los efectos desastrosos del cambio climático como consecuencia de la imprudente actividad humana.  [1] Nuestra mejor opción es convivir con el mundo natural, como las tradiciones indígenas nos han estado diciendo todo el tiempo, y Vicuña se basa en estos conceptos ancestrales para ayudar a difundir este mensaje.<blockquote><i>Proponemos reducir la velocidad rápidamente, a toda raja, antes de que sea demasiado tarde, antes de que la aceleración nauseabunda de (nuestra) destructividad nos mate a todos.  Podemos realizarlo a diario y llegará la conciencia de que otros también lo están haciendo.<br><br>Sintoniza la raja, el desgarro, la rasgadura, la abertura, el resquicio entre tus piernas, para tomar su pulso.  Deslízate fuera del tiempo y entra en la corriente cósmica. Libérate de las garras de la cosmovisión basada en las divisas monetarias y la opresión colonial y nada dentro de lo que realmente somos, indígenas del universo.</i><br>(Camila Marambio y Cecilia Vicuña, 2018)</blockquote> Durante cinco décadas, Cecilia Vicuña (n. 1948, Santiago de Chile) ha estado haciendo arte en forma de poesía, performance, instalaciones, esculturas, pinturas y acciones callejeras que se resisten al capitalismo y trastocan al colonialismo desde una perspectiva feminista.  En este momento, el trabajo de toda su vida es más urgente que nunca.<blockquote><i>Una obra dedicada al gozo no es una obra apolítica, porque quiere hacer sentir la urgencia del presente, que es la urgencia de la revolución.</i> (Cecilia Vicuña, 1973)</blockquote><br>[image2]<br><br>En 1973, el golpe militar de Augusto Pinochet derrocó al presidente chileno Salvador Allende y volcó la promesa de un futuro socialista para Chile, que en cambio se convirtió en el horror de una dictadura totalitaria.  En ese momento, Vicuña estaba estudiando en Londres y se vio profundamente afectada por esta catástrofe política. Estaba trabajando en <i>Sabor a mi</i> (1973), su primer libro de poemas eróticos y feministas, el cual ella rápidamente reinventó como un manifiesto contra el golpe de Estado, y también estaba trabajando en sus pinturas falsamente naif (faux-naive) de la década de 1970, que incluían temáticas que abarcaban a Fidel Castro, el amor cuir y las marchas de protesta. El arte y la política entonces se entrelazan de manera indeleble y, desde ese momento, ella trabaja para contrarrestar la pérdida de la esperanza con una enérgica determinación.<br><br>Vicuña rechaza la noción de que la poesía es elitista y erudita, sacándola de la academia y llevándola a las calles.  En el performance <i>Vaso de Leche / Glass of Milk</i> (1979), derramó un vaso de “leche” (pintura blanca) en una acera en Bogotá, Colombia, y escribió un poema en el pavimento con el fin de llamar la atención sobre el delito cometido por unos comerciantes locales que agregaron pintura a la leche para aumentar sus ganancias, lo cual resultó en la muerte de 1.920 niños y ninguna acción por parte del gobierno. Su documental de 1980 <i>¿Qué es la poesía para ti?</i>, en el cual Vicuña presenta la pregunta del título a un grupo diverso de residentes de Bogotá––desde mecánicos hasta trabajadoras sexuales y estudiantes universitarios,–– afirma que el arte y la poesía no pertenecen solo a la clase alta.  Vicuña se niega a tratar con condescendencia a su audiencia conformada por ciudadanos comunes; su trabajo es decididamente complejo y conceptual.<br><br>[image3]<br><br><i> Palabrarmas </i> es un neologismo compuesto por los términos “palabra” y “armas”.  Los acertijos de Vicuña son ingeniosos juegos de palabras que se convierten en signos literales de protesta destinados a provocar acciones globales.  La palabra “verdad” se deshace para convertirse en <i>dar ver</i> (dar vista), y <i>pala</i> (herramienta que sirve para excavar) emerge de <i>palabra</i> para revelar una potencial arma ejecutora física dentro del texto.  Creadas a finales de los 60 y 70, las <i>Palabrarmas</i> de Vicuña audazmente proponen que el lenguaje puede combatir la violencia en una época de corrupción desenfrenada y espantosos crímenes. Originalmente, ella las había llamado adivinaciones para denotar su conexión espiritual. Estas frases inventadas usan el lenguaje de forma conjunta con el arte visual como una herramienta intelectual y una fuerza mística. El poder simbólico del lenguaje es evidente hoy en día en las protestas del movimiento conocido como Las Vidas Negras Importan (Black Lives Matters): el eslogan como tal ha sido pintado a gran escala en las calles vacías de centros urbanos y a lo largo de los edificios tapiados para mostrar solidaridad con el movimiento, al igual que muchas paredes han sido marcadas con frases poéticas y citas de personas como Martin Luther King Jr. y Nelson Mandela. <br><br>[image4]<br><blockquote><i>Las palabras quieren hablar; escucharlas es la primera tarea.</i> (Cecilia Vicuña, 1984)</blockquote> Las lecturas de poesía de Vicuña son eventos memorables que mezclan ritual e intelecto.  Canalizando a un chamán, ella canta en español, inglés y dialectos autóctonos de América Latina, como el quechua y el mapuche, alternando idiomas para destruir la hegemonía del inglés. Con lana roja, ella va rodeando a los absortos miembros de la audiencia, dirigiéndose hacia el frente de la sala. Vicuña ignora constantemente los límites entre los medios artísticos, negándose a encajar perfectamente dentro de las categorías predeterminadas por el mundo comercial del arte occidental.  Las lecturas se transforman en performance.  La poesía se convierte en signos de protesta.  Las esculturas son absorbidas por el mar.<blockquote><i>El sol teje el hilo de la vida alrededor del mundo, la tierra es un telar y el sol teje la noche y el día </i> (Cecilia Vicuña, 1997)</blockquote> Cuando nos encontramos, me dice que el <i>Tao Te Ching</i>, el texto fundamental del taoísmo, ha tenido un profundo efecto en ella: “Permanecer en el Camino antiguo / Dominar lo que ahora ha llegado a ser / Y sondear su antigua fuente: Esto se llama <i>el hilo del Camino</i> ”. Puedo ver cómo este énfasis en la armonía de las fuerzas productivas del cosmos resuena con el propio respeto de Vicuña hacia las culturas antiguas, así como el concepto del hilo como fuerza conectiva es una herramienta y una metáfora que recorre su obra.  Los hilos de Vicuña son tejidos a partir de lana y otras fibras orgánicas que tienen una larga historia estética y utilitaria.<br><br>[image5]<br><br>Sus instalaciones inmersivas compuestas por ovillos de lana suave rinden homenaje a los quipus, un intrincado sistema de cuerdas anudadas utilizado por las culturas precolombinas para la contabilidad y el mantenimiento de registros. Como instrumentos creados antes del lenguaje verbal, los quipus eran hechos con textiles por su poder simbólico y su ligereza. Los quipus viajaban como mensajes codificados transportados por corredores (chaskis) a través de todo el universo Inka, desde Ecuador hasta Chile.  Se dice que la intención del uso de los quipus indígenas era la transmisión de la memoria, sin embargo, su uso original no se conoce con certeza. Adoptando las incertidumbres que rodean a los quipus, las instalaciones de Vicuña evocan estos sistemas de conocimiento andino que fueron destruidos por los regímenes coloniales, abarcando los temas de disolución, supresión y tergiversación. Vicuña no le teme a la asociación de carácter feminista del arte textil, sus quipus a menudo son teñidos de color sangre para afirmar el dominio matriarcal relacionado a la menstruación. Esta adopción del color rojo continúa la celebración del cuerpo femenino que Vicuña comenzó con su desafiante pintura feminista <i>Ángel de la menstruación</i> (1973).<br><br>[image6]<br><br>“La presencia da a las cosas su valor, pero la ausencia las hace funcionar”, dice el <i>Tao Te Ching</i>.  Los <i>precarios</i> de Vicuña, pequeñas esculturas de objetos encontrados compuestos por elementos naturales y desechos plásticos, expresan una aceptación de la naturaleza efímera de las cosas. Se resisten a la conservación, ya que se degradarán con el tiempo. Vicuña no pensó que su primer <i>precario</i>, creado en una playa de Chile en 1966, estaba terminado hasta que fue arrastrado por la marea.  Desde entonces, ha construido cientos de estas frágiles esculturas, a menudo cerca de cuerpos de agua y con frecuencia al aire libre.  Estos combinan objetos cotidianos en yuxtaposiciones sorprendentes y reveladoras que ella llama \"metáforas en el espacio\".<br><br>[image7]<br><br>Elaborados con materiales orgánicos como ramas, plumas y hojas, y desechos sintéticos como retazos de tela, cuerdas y piezas de equipos electrónicos, los <i>precarios</i> comulgan con la naturaleza sin someterla a la violencia.  Reflejan la degradación ambiental, pero también abarcan la idea de la desaparición y, en particular, la desaparición de los pueblos indígenas.  Vicuña a veces se refiere a los <i>precarios</i> como \"basuritas\" o \"pequeña basura\", las cuales son referencias literales de los materiales desechados que forman estas exquisitas esculturas. Sin embargo, estos también hacen referencia a su sensación de ser tratada como basura dentro del mundo del arte occidental dominante siendo una mujer y artista latinoamericana. Los <i>precarios</i> reconocen que una parte significativa de la población mundial, en particular las mujeres BIPOC (negras, indígenas y personas de color) viven de forma precaria en la era del capitalismo patriarcal y global.<br><br>[image8]<br><blockquote>\"<i>La Gitana Dormida (Un león vigila su cuaderno de sueños)\"<br><br> La gitana ha escrito durante años<br> Una obra secreta que nadie jamás<br>conocerá, pero que ha empezado<br> a realizarse en la vida real.<br><br> Mientras ella continúa soñando<br> sus sueños forman el mundo.<br><br> El león, sin embargo,<br> no puede dormir.<br> Si deja de vigilarla,<br> ella podría despertar<br> y nosotros desaparecer<br> instantáneamente.</i><br> (Cecilia Vicuña, 1966-1971)</blockquote> Si Vicuña es la protagonista de este poema, entonces su presagio se ha hecho realidad: el texto secreto ha comenzado a materializarse en la vida real. En el otoño de 2019, Chile vivió una protesta nacional para exigir el cambio. Enfurecidos y movilizados por la desigualdad económica desenfrenada en el país, los chilenos salieron a las calles en protesta. Durante una de mis visitas a su taller, ella me cuenta que las mujeres jóvenes de Santiago recientemente rehicieron sus carteles de <i>Palabrarmas</i> y usaron hilo rojo como parte de sus acciones durante el movimiento de resistencia.<br><br>El trabajo de Vicuña es, y siempre ha sido, profético y urgente.  Ella retrocede en el tiempo para encontrar verdades ancestrales enterradas por historias coloniales. Incluso la solución a los incendios forestales que actualmente están arrasando con California podría estar arraigada a las prácticas indígenas que solo unos pocos recuerdan. [2] Contrariamente a la arrogancia del mundo del arte y de la codicia del neoliberalismo, Vicuña recurre a las conexiones profundas entre la humanidad y la naturaleza para expresar la precariedad de nuestra existencia.<br><br>Mientras que, literalmente, el mundo se incendia a nuestro alrededor, vivir en condiciones precarias se ha convertido en la norma más que en la excepción. En California, la tasa de desempleo subió al 18,2% en julio, frente al 3,9% de enero. Junto a la repentina pérdida de puestos de trabajo, aumenta enormemente la falta de vivienda y de seguridad alimentaria. Las escuelas públicas del Estado han estado cerradas durante seis meses. En todo el país, la policía está asesinando a personas negras y el país está siendo dividido por un presidente fascista. Ante estos horrores nos preguntamos: ¿Qué papel juega el arte en la revolución?  ¿Puede el arte marcar la diferencia? ¿Cómo podemos utilizar el arte como herramienta para comprender mejor el mundo y a nosotros mismos? ¿Es el arte suficiente?  Abordamos estas preguntas a través de la obra de Cecilia Vicuña, cuyo trabajo aborda temas relacionados con la agitación (y destellos de esperanza) de nuestro momento presente.<br><br><i>Mientras ella sigue soñando, sus sueños crean el mundo.</i><br><br><br>Notas al pie:<br> [1] Recientemente, la estrecha relación que hay entre la propagación de enfermedades infecciosas y el cambio climático ha sido espeluznantemente más clara. <a href =\'https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/c-change/subtopics/coronavirus-and-climate-change/ \'target=\'new\'> https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/  c-change / subtemas / coronavirus-y-cambio-climático / </a><br><br>[2] <a href = \'https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/us/native-american-controlled-burns-california-wildfires.html<br>  \'target =\' new \'> https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/us/native-american-controlled-burns-california-wildfires.html </a>',''),(1123,1,'2020-09-12 03:53:21','2020-09-12 04:08:55',4140,'On <i>Lydia Ourahmane: Solar Cry</i>\r\nby Anthony Huberman',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'on-lydia-ourahmane-solar-cry-by-anthony-huberman',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',_binary 'Initially, I wanted to write this in the form of a chant or a hymn. Or by scatting, like Ella Fitzgerald singing over a drum solo, <i>doht dee duht boh duht dee … bahp m deel yuyl doo ee</i>. It would be a text spoken in tongues. But then, I feel my pocket vibrate and ding and see that I received a text message from Lydia. It’s a picture of a 6,000 year old Cyprus tree, along with a message: <br><br><p style=\"text-align:right\"><i>I finally worked out what faith is.</i></p> <br>Part of me wants to stop right here. I’ve already said everything that needs to be said about this exhibition: it’s made of wordless speech and sounds, vibrating onto bodies, with a message from the artist about the Long Tail of the sacred. <br><br>The only way to respond to her message, I reasoned, was not to. Not via text, at least. The topic of faith is far too big, too old, and too loaded to get into, but in a broad and abstract sense, perhaps it’s what we need when we come face to face with the unintelligible. It’s what rushes to the rescue when we jump into a void, preventing the vertigo that comes with having no points of reference. It’s when <i>belief</i> becomes a basis and form of understanding—which can be comforting but also dangerous. Religion, for example, is one way to organize faith or belief around a certain set of principles and rituals. But beyond whichever ideas or explanations our beliefs might provide us, they are also <i>experiences</i>. Something happens to the body. <br><br>Lydia Ourahmane is interested in how belief is registered on the body, in the ways it is made <i>material</i>. Even if belief is a mental state, she asks, does it also have physical repercussions? How does faith or belief materialize, as it rushes through bodies? Does it leave a mark of where it’s been? And does it linger in empty buildings, like an echo, long after believers have left? What types of human belief systems has that Cyprus tree witnessed? <br><br>The title of her exhibition, صرخة شمسية <i>Solar Cry</i>, is borrowed from a short text by Georges Bataille where he describes the sun as the most abstract of all objects because it’s impossible to look at. As such, he claims, it represents all that is elevated and out of reach—the sacred. It turns out that Bataille also used many other words to describe the sacred: <i>impossible, inner experience, absence of God, peak experience, rapturous self-loss, altered state, silence</i>. If faith is what we turn to when faced with the unintelligible, the sacred is that sense of suspension that happens right before we do so. Religion might be there to provide answers, as is logic, science, morality, and so on, but the sacred is the stunned interrogation itself, the negative space that precedes and envelops all of those explanations. It can’t be performed because it’s always already there, and it can only ever be witnessed, never obtained. It’s experienced as a lack, an absence, a short pause, a skip in the record, and it reveals all the noise that is the human experience. <br><br><p style=\"text-align:right\"><i>Alain Badiou talks about an inaesthetics, about inserting a lack into an instance of plenitude,</i> I write back.</p><br>A Solar Cry, then, is one where silence is sovereign. It’s a cry that thickens all the interruptions and the intervals between sounds—the suspended part of the beat that makes the rhythm. It’s the gaps that open up between the grooves.  With this exhibition, Ourahmane harvests the space’s past and present silences, making them ready for visitors to witness. She creates a context where some of those sacred cries might be felt, even for a short moment, and where they can leave traces behind as they pass by. <br><br><p style=\"text-align:right\">Another ding and vibration. <i>I want to create a context that produces the potential for a miracle.</i></p><br>The artist’s own past has left its traces on her, obviously. For her, faith and belief contain the experience of war. She was born in Algeria, to parents who were active members of a Christian minority, and grew up near Oran, in a commune-like safe house her family ran. It was a place that welcomed fellow believers and recent converts, giving them a place to be together. At the same time, this act of gathering made them exposed and vulnerable to extremists who were fighting an authoritarian government in a brutal civil war that would last over a decade, with countless killed. In that context, to <i>believe</i> meant putting your body, your life, and your children’s lives in danger—as a member of a persecuted minority. Belief became a contestation of social, political, and military pressures, which squeezed those bodies into a vice, limiting or preventing their freedom of speech and movement. By necessity, people learned to live within the negative spaces. Even after the war ended, in 2002, the state prohibited any form of public gathering and it was only recently, in 2019, that the people began claiming physical space and occupying the streets. <br><br>Living through all of this has taught Ourahmane about different forms of escape and departure. She has learned to recognize, trust, and even foster the experience of negative space—<i>the unintelligible, the impossible, the absence of God, rapturous self-loss, silence, the sacred</i>. This can’t be articulated or arrived at via language or images because miracles are never ideas, at least not initially. They are always felt. They are material, like a bullet that hits a wall just inches away, or like an apple falling on Newton’s head. <br><br><p style=\"text-align:right\"><i>Ding. Bzzz.</i> This time, it’s a link to a PDF of “Who Touched Me?,” where Fred Moten tells Wu Tsang that all we are are instruments.</p><br>صرخة شمسية <i>Solar Cry</i> is an orchestra. In the main gallery, an opera singer sings with herself. There is speech but no words, as if a voice had been liberated from language and allowed to remain closer to breath, or as if a breath had been stopped before it could become language. Stacking the voices on top of each other creates a thickness, where what counts is their materiality, their weight in the room. The recordings can’t possibly be in synch, and yet, as they pile on top of each other, over time, they might find each other and open up small moments of synchronicity and resonance, like secret lovers. <br><br><p style=\"text-align:right\">Bzzzding. <i>I’m interested in how it’s possible to speak something into existence.</i></p><br><br>A few months before the exhibition, Ourahmane traveled to Tassili N’Ajjer, a plateau of rock valleys and formations in the Algerian Sahara desert, on the border with Libya and Mali, where 15,000 cave paintings date back 12,000 years. The experience of the desert, much like that of the sacred, cannot be articulated via language but can only be witnessed. Like the sacred, the desert is too big to see. Like the ocean, it, too, is inhospitable to humankind. It swallows presence. She went there to listen to its absence and to record its silence. <br><br><img src=\'/media/02554.jpg\'> <img src=\'/media/02555.jpg\'> <img src=\'/media/02556.jpg\'> <img src=\'/media/02557.jpg\'> <img src=\'/media/02558.jpg\'> <img src=\'/media/02559.jpg\'> <img src=\'/media/02560.jpg\'> <img src=\'/media/02561.jpg\'><br><br>What she heard was the loud voicelessness of all that had passed through there. The cave paintings told the story of how the plateau was once full of people and lush with green. She learned that the area had once been a route for trade between Algeria and Niger, where fathers would sell their sons for the price of three kilos of salt—as the story goes. Today, people go there with metal detectors and search the sand for lost gold. Tassili N’Ajjer is also home to the Tuareg people, who inherited the knowledge of how to handle its harsh conditions. Ourahmane took a photograph of a Cyprus tree that somehow survives it all. <br><br>She embeds her experience into the gallery walls. Inspired by the marks still visible on the rocks after thousands of years—ones made by bodies who have defied being forgotten—she etches into the building, tagging a surface behind the gallery walls, and leaves behind a sign that will outlast the exhibition’s presence, like an echo. She installs transducer speakers (usually used for sound therapy) inside another wall, and her sub-decibel recordings of the desert make it vibrate with thousands of years of silence. Because one way to transmit the impossible scale of the desert—and the impossible scale of faith, belief, or the miraculous—is to give weight to its emptiness, to thicken its absences. <i>The beat becomes the buzz</i>, Fred tells Wu. <br><br><p style=\"text-align:right\">Bzzzz. Bzzzz. Bzzzz. I had set it to vibrate-only. A last one: <i>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQvcGVhJ334</i>, a lecture by Hypatia Vourloumis in Amsterdam — <i>We synchronize our tempos to find a rhythm through which the urge to live is expressed collectively. In this way, we set the world in motion, where poets can become the timekeepers of revolution.</i></p><br>Listening impacts the body. It implicates and <i>enlists</i> the body. Without being mediated by language, logic, or anything else, it touches the body and makes it move. As visitors to this exhibition, we vibrate together, like a chorus of instruments. Sounds and silences become pressure points, in a choreography of repetitions, for bodies to come up against the potential for something unintelligible. <br><br>*<br><br>Lydia Ourahmane (b. 1992, Saïda, Algeria) lives and works in Algiers.

They survey the book’s contents, give a visual presentation of anomalous artifacts from the obsessive self-documenter’s vast personal ephemera archive, share an excerpt from Baldwin’s newly digitized found-footage essay <i>Wild Gunman</i> (1978), and present an online premiere of Baldwin’s “lost/rediscovered” early Super 8 performance film, the barnstorming ‘70s cinema time capsule <i>Stolen Movie</i> (1976). <br><br>About the films: <br><i>Wild Gunman</i>: Mobilizing wildly diverse found-footage fragments, obsessive optical printing, and a dense “musique concrète” soundtrack, a maniac montage of pop-cultural amusements, cowboy iconography, and advertising imagery is re-contextualized within the contemporary geopolitical crisis in a scathing critique of U.S. cultural and political imperialism. Thanks to Anthology Film Archives.<br><br><i>Stolen Movie</i>: Armed with a Super 8 camera and sound-person (John Corser), Baldwin runs both recording devices continuously through single-take raids on a series of SF Market Street grindhouse theaters.

Conceived during this pandemic era, the immersive video work depicts the American flag in unsettling stillness, as a marker of territory, and projected onto bodies, while set to a heartrending soundtrack. At once melancholic and beautiful, Gibson renders the iconic image of the flag as both elastic and unyielding. The slow transformation through time, color, and form reflects both a distillation of our social collapse and the reinvention of self and community, referencing the movement and change that is so desired for this nation.<br><br><i>Nothing is Eternal</i> belongs to no one and everyone, a piece that moves like water through the Bay Area and beyond, slow and stretched across time. It appears in multiple locations simultaneously or in one for a while. It is, like the rest of us, ungrounded and melancholic and it is, like this time, irresolute. Presented during the 2020 general election, it embodies the contradiction of emotions that pervade our lives, yesterday as much as today, as we head towards an uncertain future. The work posits hope as much as it evinces a sense of mourning. Gibson asks viewers to imagine a destiny beyond our comprehension, on a pathway paved with both tremendous love and immense sorrow.<br><br>Reopening should not be a return.

So we reckon now as a time to continue to dream, to continue that tradition, as the real protection of Black life requires that we imagine a different order entirely. What is revolutionary about Black thinking is less a program of liberation, but a poetics of liberation. The form was verse, the meaning was a future free of imposition. Yet what became important about such a conception was that this future was not a direction or a destination—it was simply a way of being. The Black Radical tradition is a seeking and a searching for a mode of society, of being together that resists the exclusionary impulse at the heart of the “modern” state or colonial project.

We are replete with fearful predictions, as historically the other side has looked a lot like this side, sometimes worse, and if not worse than only negligibly better. There are desperate longings, for something, <I>anything</i> other than the molten sludge of despair we reside within. A cruel spring has bled, quite literally, into a remorseless summer, and now we are on the cusp of a hopeless autumn. Too many things anger us, disappoint us, sadden us, too many bodies lost and not enough bodies putting themselves on the line because too many people are not angry, disappointed, or sad <I>enough</i>. The ratio of tears to days is incalculable. Nous sommes fatigués.<br><br>This urge to return to a sense of normalcy—an instinctive answer to overwhelming exhaustion—is nostalgia in its truest, most dangerous definition. Uncritical, awash with the wrong kinds of sentimentality, a violent, individuated response to a world that is moving in all the ways that feel antithetical to the life that was promised. Our resistance must come in a multitude of forms, but the collective refusal to return to any normative narratives is paramount to getting to the other side, <I>after</i>, wherever it is, and that includes the cancellation of time and how it is understood and remembered. This is not a denial or disavowal of our memories but the rejection of a singular temporality and, in the words of Lisa Lowe, a <i>questioning of recovery</i>, which “combines the desire for freedom and a reckoning with the conditions of its foreclosure.”<br><br>For those whose knives sharpen with each passing year, there is no hope without terror, no desire without necessity. The other side, or the complete rupture of all systems and structures, of all relations, requires feeling every inch of memory in our bones as they break, but they <I>must</i> break, each and every last one. We have yet to properly contend with our present and by present we include everything that with regularity is associated with the past, what in actuality is <i>not over</i>. Settler colonialism, slavery, racialized expropriation, all the brutal catastrophes that are oft framed as historic to allow the present to be drawn into a portrait of overcoming. But what if the echo is also a tentacle? <br><br>As Lowe expands:<br><br>“The phrase <i>questioning recovery</i>, then, names a broad critical project that scrutinizes the present as both aftermath and continuity and calls attention to the conditions of slavery and colonialism that infuse the conditions, memories, and possibilities of the present. It foregrounds the persistence of unfreedom belying liberal narratives of progress that would triumphantly declare the present a time of freedom and asserts instead that the present is a time in which emancipation has not yet occurred, in which freedom is still yet to come.”<br><br>Not after. <i>Yet</i>. <br><br>Lowe points to the impossibility of the present being an after, with so much left undone, while critiquing the impulse for and the very conception of <I>after</i> altogether. Our obsession with the future is rooted in a hunger for potential, for a site of possibility and freedom. The fixation is so great, however, that it reflects a weakness against struggle, of being unsettled. The more we pine for the future the more we forget the past and the convenience of letting go, obscuring, and constructing competing narratives of emancipation and historicization is too alluring. Acceleration to the <I>after</i> leaves a wake of erasure and omission in service of the something, <I>anything</i> other than. <br><br><p align=\"center\">after, mourning, remedy, release</p><br><br>Recovery of and a return to normativity reproduces dispossession and the current social order, and within this framework an <i>after</i> unencumbered by the past is just another impossible. There is no articulation or understanding of <I>yet</i> that can exist without first mourning and attending to what was lost and what was never able to become. Where do we go? (Or, <i>when</i> do we go?) <br><br>To come back to now, on this day burning with hundreds of fires, we wonder if we will ever get to the other side. We ache. <br><br>At the time of writing, this piece remains incomplete. We do not know how it ends or even if it begins as it did. We imagine it to be a secret or a key, with iconography to be deciphered using a vernacular out of our repertoires. Or is it a message or remnant from the era of the unresolved? The work itself is the materialization of its own making, adapting and shapeshifting each week and again every month when the world decides to slide beneath our soles for the eight hundredth time. It will land far from where it began (as will we). <br><br>Giving a spine to this pandemic era is perhaps an embodiment of what Raymond Williams refers to as the <i>structure of feeling</i>. Sensations and sensibilities that are pre-articulation and without discernible form yet still construct consciousness, determine relationships, and establish trajectories. The affective narrative precedes developed thought and creates a foundation for new formations of thought to emerge. We are feeling this work, as we are feeling this time, before it fully comes into being.<br><br><p align=\"center\">yet, surrender, courage, dread, and and</p> <br><br>What are the conditions required for transformation? To become? How do we exit this time into another? A bird falls out of the tree and something is set into motion. As the seconds unravel we recall the panic and paranoia, the onslaught of loss, the loneliness, finding a way back to joy for it to slip through our fingers again, the softness that undergirds our fury and the fury that fortifies our softness. What is broken is sewn together, what cannot be sewn is alight. Melancholy begets hope which beflowers dread as this nation crumbles around us, as our chests feel the pieces come apart one stripe at a time until only the stars remain in the sky. We are ruined, we adapt, we remake, we remember. We live without time, without place. We grieve.<br><br>But, love. No immense sorrow without tremendous love. This era is wrought with all the things we do because we love each other, not because we want to be loved. An indecent and irrational love that binds us to one another and allows us to endure, to dream of a <I>yet</i> not for ourselves but for everyone unmet we hold dear. It too will waver and dissipate, with no guarantee of being reborn, but we must believe it to be resilient and eternal regardless. Even with our eyes closed we feel the colours wash over us. A warmth unfelt since before, or <I>before</i> before, it is uncertain, we have abandoned all our clocks and we have done away with recovery anyhow. <br><br>This time may have all along been a tremble. A capacious moment that opened all the portals and propelled us to refuse recognition from the present, to <i>feel</i> to the point of depletion everything that came before. There is no going back.<br><br>The pathway to <i>yet</i> remains unwritten. We are witnessing this in real time, living this unfastened life in which everyday is like no other day. Even still, we are seduced by feelings of progress and continuity because it is part of our survival. We think about how we will be with one another again and how we will be <I>for</i> one another (truly, fully). What we do know is that on this course we carry everything with us—the misery & the tenderness & all that remains unfinished, with a past that functions like albatross and armor, as we work towards absolute estrangement; of this logic and these patterns, of these bodies, of this life. Every day another fracture that splinters the system, another inch closer to complete collapse. We are terrified, we are exhilarated.<br><br>A goodbye to the life we had, a quiver before sweet surrender. <br><br>*<br><br>Jeffrey Gibson (b. 1972, Colorado, US) lives and works in the Hudson Valley, New York.

Conceived during this pandemic era, the immersive video work depicts the American flag in unsettling stillness, as a marker of territory, and projected onto bodies, while set to a heartrending soundtrack. At once melancholic and beautiful, Gibson renders the iconic image of the flag as both elastic and unyielding.

His work references various aesthetic and material histories rooted in Indigenous cultures of the Americas, and in modern and con- temporary subcultures. Gibson, a member of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians and of Cherokee descent, is forging a multifarious practice that redresses the exclusion and erasure of Indigenous art traditions from the history of Western art as it explores the complexity and fluidity of identity.<br><br>Jeffrey Gibson (b. 1972, Colorado, US) lives and works in the Hudson Valley, New York.

They were used by the ancient peoples of the Andes as ways to transmit numerical and statistical information and also to record stories, poems and genealogies. Less than 1,000 quipus exist today due to the deterioration of their natural material, but also due to intentional destruction by Spanish colonizers during the sixteenth century. Quipus were forms of language in their own right, wherein meaning was woven into textile and knotted cords. It was a language which the Spanish themselves could not understand, and thus they sought to eradicate the quipus when instating their own position of power.<br><br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03466.jpg\' style=\'width:67%\'> </span><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03467.jpg\' style=\'width:29%\'><br><br>Vicuña began to make her own versions of quipus in the 1960s as a recurring part of her practice. She has written, “Five thousand years ago the Andes peoples created the quipu, a poem in space, a way to remember, involving the body and the cosmos at once. A tactile, spatial metaphor for the union of all. The quipu were banished after the Conquest. Quipus were burnt, but the vision of interconnectivity, a poetic resistance endures underground.”<br><br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03468.jpg\' style=\'width:43%\'> </span><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03469.jpg\' style=\'width:54%\'><br><br>Vicuña’s 2018 installation at the Brooklyn Museum in New York paired ancient quipus from the museum’s collection with an environmental quipu commissioned on the occasion of the exhibition. The museum’s statement reads, “Together, these quipus of the past and present explore the nature of language and memory, the resilience of native people in the face of colonial repression, and Vicuna’s own experiences living in exile from her native Chile.”<br><br>Vicuña has written about the erasure of her own indigenous history – its suppression by her grandmother and mother, who did not publicly share this aspect of their identities. Her <i>quipus</i> seek to reactivate the spirit of those ancient cultures, which live on through her, her work, and that of her peoples.<br><br><br><br><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Precarios</i></p><br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03470.jpg\'><br><br>Crain read an excerpt from a section dedicated to Vicuña’s precarious works (1966-2015) included in the 2018 publication <i>new and selected poems of cecilia vicuña</i> published by Kelsey Street Press. <br><br><span style=\"margin-left:3em\"></span>“<i>Lo precario</i> (the precarious) is a way of being in the land, a series of gestures and site-specific performance installations created collaboratively with the elements. Works for the sea or street traffic to erase. <br><span style=\"margin-left:3em\"></span>To name a work for its dissolution responds to ancient vision: the path of the planets, the sun, and the moon are named for their disappearance: <i>ecliptic</i>. <br><span style=\"margin-left:3em\"></span>The precarious are metaphors in space.

They are ephemeral, transitory and prone to deterioration. They are often made from foraged materials - be they natural or man-made detritus - and are considered complete in their physical erosion or in their potential to decay. The pictured work from 1967 was completed when swept out to sea, and thus illustrates Vicuña’s continuous return to a reciprocity with the Earth. The <i>precarios</i> work through an ongoing engagement with the idea of disappearance, and specifically with the disappearance of Indigenous cultures.<br><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03471.jpg\' style=\'width:55%\'></p><br>In June of 1973, when the Chilean right wing and the army were conspiring to overthrow the Popular Unity government of Salvador Allende, Vicuña began to make an object everyday for one year in support of the revolution. Each object or journal entry was constructed from debris from the streets of London. As this red silk work textually states, Vicuna’s objects intended to support the popular resistance against the dictatorship.<br><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03472.jpg\' style=\'width:55%\'></p> <br>The <i>precarios</i> are full of pain. They seek to remember, honor, and invoke that which has been disappeared, destroyed, and erased, while they also illuminate the nature of our own existential condition - to return to the Earth. They mark a life without the promise of stability, which can either incite our anxieties or remind us of what it means to be present. Precarity is ultimately the nature of life, yet it is often resisted, in forceful attempts to stabilize and control.<br><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03473.jpg\' style=\'width:55%\'></p><br>In conversations and interviews, Vicuña often refers to <i>Mummy’s Skirt</i>. It is a <i>precario</i> from 1987, which is made of one of Cecilia’s own, aged pieces of clothing. Years after making the work, Vicuna visited a gallery in New York specializing in pre-Columbian art and saw a precarious object quite similar to her own; however, this relic was recovered from a tomb and was over 2000 years old. It is not unlikely that Vicuña may relate such an experience to being one full of the “life force” - an energy that is latent in all of existence - connecting bodies, memories, customs, and experiences through millenia. The histories of her ancestors are deep seeded within her,a part of her own fiber, as ours are within us. <br><br><br><br><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Metaphors in Space</i></p><br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03474.jpg\'><br><br>Vicuña’s transformative acts or metaphors in space take the forms of poems, films, performances, songs, sculpture or collaborations with nature. The following images briefly contextualize a few examples. These metaphors in space exist within liminal experience. They confront structures of colonial and capitalist imposition, address environmental crises, and draw attention to the displaced, the marginalized, and the vanished. <br><br>Cecilia Vicuña has written, “<i>Espiral y Mar / Spiral and Sea</i> was created at the junction of two waters, the Aconcagua River and the Pacific Ocean, the sea completes the work, erasing it.”<br><br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03475.jpg\' style=\'width:64%\'> </span><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03478.jpg\' style=\'width:34.2%\'><br><br>In June of 1971, Cecilia filled a gallery of the National Museum of<br>Fine Arts with autumn leaves, and dedicated the work to the construction of socialism. As Miguel López wrote in the essay discussed by the reading group, “The work was not something to see, but to feel under feet, to smell, to hear the sound of crunching as one walked in the leaves.” Vicuna wrote that the work was to be appreciated internally, behind the eyes, and thus experienced inside the body.<br><br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03477.jpg\'><br><br>Of her <i>Guante</i> performances, Cecilia has written, “During a bus ride I would raise a hand gloved in a glove begloved. The glove is not a glove, but a primordial mythic being. (The bus, too, moves in primordial mythic time.) When a girl is born, her mother puts a spider in her hand, to teach her how to weave. Thread is the memory of the journey unraveling.” <br><br>.<br><br><i>How might we activate, acknowledge, and either resurrect or attempt to reckon with these histories?</i><br><br>*<br><br>Notes:<br>(1) <i>Precario/Precarious</i>, translated by Anne Twitty, Tanam Press (New York, 1983).<br><br>Images:<br>(1) Cecilia Vicuña <i>London Quipu, Journal of Objects for the Chilean Resistance</i>, 1974.

López; as well as, an essay, “A Conquest Foretold” (1998), by Ranajit Guha, an historian of the Indian subcontinent and leading figure in postcolonial and subaltern studies. The reading group thought through Vicuña’s vast and diverse body of work - particularly drawing from the symbolic resonance and motivations in her <a href=\'/browse-the-library/911/reading-lists-conversations-and-other-texts/whose-footsteps-are-these-a-preface-to-cecilia-vicua-a-by-jenni-crain\' target= \'new\'><i>Quipus, Precarios, and Metaphors in Space</i></a>, while cross-reading their concepts through the themes addressed in the two focal essays. The conversation considered the ways in which courses and constructions of time are forms of measure and mark making, of control and erasure, but also threads of continuity coalescing bodies, beliefs, and landscapes. <br><br>. <br><br><i>In the Andes they say:<br>\"The time has come to renew the past.<br>The future is behind: it has not yet arrived.\"<br><br>If the memory of an event is a \"trace\" in the land, the actions that took place long ago are \"etched\" there, but \"long ago\" may become tomorrow anytime!</i><br><br>- Cecilia Vicuña<br><br>.<br><br>The following includes passages, statements, references, and ideas explored by the group collectively as Crain guided the conversation in reference to the aforementioned essays and Vicuña’s work. This reading group and conversation was comprised by the participation of Selam Bekele, Leyla Cardenas, Ben Chaffee, Nan Collymore, Mariwyn Curtin, Juliana Gerdts, Jeanne Gerrity, Jo Giardini, Anthony Huberman, Miles Huston, Jordi Infield, Theo Lau, Frances Phillips, Christine Howard Sandoval, Maxine Schoefer-Wulf, Lara Macarena Schoorl, Giovanni Singleton, Selby Sohn, Diego Villalobos.<br><br>.<br><br>Ranajit Guha’s essay, ‘A Conquest Foretold,’ brings into question the selective constructs of imperialist historiography. In his writings at large, as in this essay, Guha encourages the consideration and an embrace of a more extensive understanding of history, one which generates space for pasts and peoples whose histories have been eliminated, while also emphasizing the historical nature of everyday life. <br><br><i>How can we rewrite and re-member the strategically disappeared into a more truthful, resounding understanding of history?</i><br><br>In the opening section, “A Small Victory Called Conquest,” Guha writes of the Battle of Plassey as the demonstrative moment conceived to signify the British conquest of the continent of India. He writes, “The context of pain that niggles us, shadows every reference to us as the colonized or once colonized, is part of a legacy that dates back to early years of British rule in South Asia and was passed on through successive generations… The turmoil and sensitivities of that difficult transition not only added to the intensity of the pain but taught us at the same time to contextualize it in history.” (1)<br><br>While one battle does not eradicate the cultural complexities of successive generations, it is implemented to name and issue datability as a structure relative to conquest. When is made relative to before and after. <br><br>For the conqueror, the approach to power is a right of arms, of domination, of violence, which stifles - as opposed to negotiation, dominion, alliance, or compact, which enables a mutuality and thus a futurity for the advance of both peoples, of peoples together.<br><br><i>What is power? What is dominion? Where can we see openings for the productive possibilities of both?</i><br><br>In her work and in the presence that surrounds her work, Vicuña creates a power that aims to decentralize hierarchy. Not all power looks the same. Not all power must seek to oppress. Power can be quiet and power can be passed on. It can be an offering, like Vicuña’s own to the ocean. <br><br><i>Rather than demarcating a specific moment to symbolize transition or imposition of power, why not “unpick” the fortified moments, giving power to the moments that dissolve into the fabric of our daily lives?</i> <br><br>A river swells. <br><br><i>We know the story of those who sailed ashore, but what about that of those who saw the ship on the horizon?</i><br><br>While Guha suggests “The Other Story,” as the final section of his essay is titled (2), Vicuña’s work extends the proposition of “A Story to Add to.” In Vicuña’s work, time remains malleable. Change is embraced. By both preserving and reanimating the disappeared, while also acknowledging the nature of disappearance itself, Vicuña’s work dissuades the comprehension of a singular narrative. As both Guha and Vicuña would recognize, one date or one narrative cannot quantify trauma as a single act. There is an ongoing performance, which moves in multiple directions, and our temporal understanding must be renegotiated, redistributed. <br><br>Utopia is not a “no place.” It is a No! Place. A refusal of a definition of place. No! may be an anticanonical exploration of the unpreserved, of bodily joy, of pleasure, of embodied experience. <br><br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03480.jpg\'><br><br>In his essay, Miguel A. López writes, “In September 1967, Vicuña wrote a draft of the ‘No-Manifesto’ [<a href=\'https://www.makemag.com/the-no-manifesto-of-tribu-no-by-cecilia-vicuna-2/\' target= \'new\'>Non-Manifesto</a>] in her journal; this was the document that led to the founding of the Tribu No… Tribu No was an expression of liberation and collective joy… Their improvisations came from a different genealogy [than that of happenings, art actions, and performance art of the 1960s being explored by Western artists in North America and the European continent], one that was closer to deterritorialization of the poetic field… The Tribu No organized a number of <i>non-activities</i>, many of which went unnoticed by anyone outside the group… Their <i>non-activities</i> were not an attempt to score cultural points or be put on official literature pedestals, but to spend time pleasantly and creatively with no specific purpose in mind... ” (3)<br><br>There are alternative realities. Existing systems may be subverted. And this reality may be brought into our world as a form of activism. <br><br>Guha concludes his essay gesturing towards the danger of reciprocal nationalism. Vicuña’s work is attentive to internationalisms, to multinational and indigenous politics. It may be local, but even the local is interconnected to other localities. <br><br>*<br><br>Notes: <br> (1) Ranajit Guha, “A Conquest Foretold,” in Social Text, Spring, 1998, No. 54, (Durham, NC: Duke University Press) : 85.<br> (2) Ranajit Guha, “A Conquest Foretold,” in Social Text, Spring, 1998, No. 54, (Durham, NC: Duke University Press) : 95.<br> (3) Miguel A.

This wetness brings to the table a sense of the haptic, the sensory, the bodily, and the epidermal.

Infusing narratives with both memory and imagination, Palileo translates diverse materials into a novel formal language to describe a new world of her own making.<br><br>This exhibition of new paintings and sculptures stems from research Palileo conducted at the Newberry Library in Chicago, which has one of the largest collections of Philippiniana in the world (comprising the collections of Edward E. Ayer, an American who assembled a vast trove of Phillippine 17th and 18th century manuscripts upon US victory over the Spanish at Manila Bay in 1898; and the photographic archive of Dean C. Worcester, an influential and controversial figure in the early years of American presence in the Philippines). These varied documents, spanning centuries and cultures, offered a kaleidoscopic vision of the Philippines as seen through numerous eyes, and recalled by Westerners. <br><br>Palileo recontextualizes these stories, portraits, and images in an attempt to resuscitate these figures from the exploitative gaze of these ethnographic images. Inspired by Damián Domingo, Palileo’s expressive, gestural paintings imbue a sense of humanity and dignity to the subjects. She integrates historical narratives from the colonial past of the Philippines with stories and memories of her own life as a Filipinx American growing up in the United States, producing paintings that possess dream-like qualities that hover between fact and fiction. Combining Palileo’s extensive research with narratives of American Imperialism, beginning with the Filipino-American war, and the artist’s own understanding of a fractured and complex past, the work evokes nostalgia and romanticism while critiquing the ramifications of colonization, past and present.<br><br>Maia Cruz Palileo (b. 1979, Chicago, Illinois) lives and works in Brooklyn. <br><br><a href=\"\">Maia Cruz Palileo</a>: <i>Long Kwento</i> is curated by Kim Nguyen and organized by Diego Villalobos.<br><br>[image1]',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(1148,1,'2020-12-01 08:16:30','2020-12-01 08:31:48',3737,'<i>Catching Ideas in Process: Jay DeFeoâ€™s Photography</i>, a panel discussion with Corey Keller, Paul Mpagi Sepuya and Rayyane Tabet, moderated by Emily Markert\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'catching-ideas-in-process-jay-defeoa-s-photography-a-panel-discussion-with-corey-keller-paul-mpagi-sepuya-and-rayyane-tabet-moderated-by-emily-markert',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',_binary 'This conversation is part of a series of programs focusing on Bay Area art history and celebrates the various artists, groups, and spaces that made the region’s art community what it is today and what it can be tomorrow.

It takes as its point of departure Drexciya, the late 20th century electronic music duo from Detroit, and their creation of a sonic, fictional world. Through liner notes and track titles, Drexciya take the Black Atlantic below the water with their imaginary of an Atlantis comprised of former slaves who have adapted to living underwater. This wetness brings to the table a sense of the haptic, the sensory, the bodily, and the epidermal. What below-the-water and Atlantis bring back are the bottom of the sea, the volume of the water, the materiality of the space of the ocean, and other protagonists that inhabit the sea. <i>The End of Eating Everything</i> is the third installment in <i>Black Atlantis</i>.<br><br>Ayesha Hameed lives in London, UK.

Not only was it an interesting conversation, but it made a most basic point crystal clear: <span style=\"color:#ff0000\">artists can be our leaders.</span> <br><br>[image4]<br><br>I think about the ways each of us can contribute to making artists our leaders.  What could that look like? And <span style=\"color:#ff0000\">what type of leadership can art and artists provide?</span> Sure, all artists won\'t lead in the same way or towards the same things, but I do think that artists can lead us in a different way than our politicians do: not by being our best problem-solvers but by being <span style=\"color:#ff0000\">our most curious minds,</span> our most expressive spirits, and, as such, by connecting us to a sense of horizon and possibility, even when it might not yet be fully understood. <br><br>Because leadership is not about telling people what to do or what to think as much as it\'s about articulating a broad vision and <span style=\"color:#ff0000\">providing others with the tools they need to contribute to it in their own way</span>. An artist isn\'t a leader because she\'s \"right\" but because she gives us a new, or <i>another</i>, possibility to explore.  <br><br>[image5]<br><br>At one point in the panel, Thomas brought up what the historian James Carse calls <span style=\"color:#ff0000\">finite and infinite games.</span><br><br><i>There are at least two kinds of games</i>, Carse wrote in 1986, <i>One could be called finite, the other infinite. A finite game is played for the purpose of winning, an infinite game for the purpose of continuing the play.</i><br><br>Artists, perhaps, are the leaders who enlist all of us into the infinite game of culture. They lead <span style=\"color:#ff0000\">by keeping culture complicated,</span> which is what makes it a game worth playing infinitely.<br><br>[image6]<br><br>In the year ahead, the Wattis <span style=\"color:#ff0000\">will ask how artists can be models of leadership</span> in a time when new forms of leadership is what we all need.<br><br>[image7]<br><br>Artists like <span style=\"color:#ff0000\">Cecilia Vicuña</span>, who is \"on our mind;\" like <span style=\"color:#ff0000\">Raven Chacon</span>, our 2020-2021 Capp St Artist-in-Residence; or like <span style=\"color:#ff0000\">Maia Cruz Pallileo</span>, who will show a new body of work when we reopen the physical gallery space in the fall.<br><br>[image8]<br><br>And I\'m thrilled <span style=\"color:#ff0000\">to have you along for the ride!</span> The Wattis gives our members that inspiring <span style=\"color:#ff0000\">proximity to artists</span>: You will be invited into Cecilia Vicuña\'s studio.

Minh-ha\'s decision to rewrite male characters as female is rooted in her work in feminist theory.<br>11:47 Emily Markert: ​(She is a Professor in Gender & Women\'s Studies and Rhetoric at UC Berkeley.)<br>12:29 Emily Markert: ​In Minh-ha\'s own words: \"crossings in gender time, culture, geography, and technology bring to the fore the question of formed, barely formed, and unformed relations.\"<br>12:45 Emily Markert: ​We will see these types of crossings throughout the film.<br>13:00 Shaelyn Hanes: ​These beginning scenes are some of Minh-ha’s most clear nods to Miyazawa’s Night on the Galactic Railroad.<br>13:16 Shaelyn Hanes: ​She has noted that she was drawn to the story because of its structure, which consists of an opening and closing sequence and “a space of free-flow happenings and encounters” between the two.<br>13:19 CCA Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts: ​If you are just joining us, you can always skip back to the beginning. Our chat will continue, though.<br>14:40 Emily Markert: ​This beautiful shot of Kyra biking on a long straightaway evokes the line spoken by Luis earlier: \"Sometimes you go in a straight line... and sometimes you find yourself at the crossroads.\"<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03509.png\'><br>15:14 Emily Markert: ​Biking for Minh-ha also represents personal, bodily balance.<br>18:06 Emily Markert: ​Notice how the sounds of the train and the natural world outside shift and intermingle.<br>19:08 Emily Markert: ​Nabi\'s character is also male in Night on the Galactic Railroad. Here\'s another quote from Minh-ha speaking on this subject: ​\"In feminist struggles, one recognizes the double political gesture, which consists of inserting women into history…while refusing the limiting linearity imposed by history’s time\"<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03504.png\'><br>19:48 Emily Markert: ​Nabi and Kyra\'s arrival on the train in unknowable ways rather than a series of linear events evokes these latter ideas.<br>22:41 Emily Markert: ​This line about the train clattering is a direct quote from Night on the Galactic Railroad.<br>23:31 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Minh-ha notes that she edited the film in order to give the feeling that the train is running on water.<br>24:23 Shaelyn Hanes: ​She also likens the vehicle to Roland Barthes’s Argo: a ship that is continually rebuilt piece by piece until it is an entirely new boat. We’ll see clues to this a few times during the film.<br>24:32 Shaelyn Hanes: ​She writes, “A vessel whose parts keep on changing and whose totality is in constant motion: this is also a way of digital imaging, and this is how Night Passage works for me as digital film event.”<br>25:00 Emily Markert: ​This scene points to Minh-ha\'s use of a diversity of characters and actors. (In the original book, everyone is Japanese.)<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03505.png\'><br>25:23 Emily Markert: ​Minh-ha writes: \"In normalizing diversity, multiculturalism remains deceptively color-blind and utterly divisive...Its bland melting-pot logic denies the racism and sexism that lie at the core of biopower and biopolitics.\"<br>26:02 Emily Markert: ​In the film, \"the focus is on the interaction of passages. Rather than treating difference as mere conflict…difference comes with the art of spacing and is creatively transcultural.\"<br>27:28 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Minh-ha notes that this scene invites viewers to have a “bodily response to the sound of color.” She encourages an experience of synesthesia in which we hear with our eyes and see with our ears.<br>28:00 Emily Markert: ​This scene also makes it apparent that Minh-ha shot this film digitally.<br>29:49 Emily Markert: ​On her fictional films, Minh-ha says: ​\"I work with musicians who improvise freely...This makes us all \'composers\' whose interactions are intensely defined by the art of listening in relation rather than of \'making sounds\'\"<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03506.png\'><br>30:37 VIEWER: ​did she compose the music for any of her films?<br>31:45 Emily Markert: ​A great question! She often works with other musicians to collaborative compose her film\'s soundtracks. I am not aware of any times she has done this entirely alone, though.<br>32:02 VIEWER: ​ah ok, thanks!<br>32:22 Emily Markert: ​We will look into that ahead of our next film club screening.<br>32:46 Shaelyn Hanes: ​This scene shows three electronic musicians and their equipment that play in the background.<br><br>32:57 Shaelyn Hanes: ​By revealing the musicians, Minh-ha points to the material condition of the film’s production. This speaks to her investment in the interrelation between concept and form.<br>33:11 Emily Markert: ​Throughout Night Passage, Minh-ha treats \"sound not as sound effects but as music, making full use of the forbidden yield of what the classic, musically trained ear calls ‘noise’ or ‘nonmusical.’”<br>33:48 Emily Markert: ​When I watch this scene, I wonder -- Do you think the characters can hear everything we are hearing? Or are we in their heads?<br>34:29 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Here the passengers find themselves in what might be the bowels of a ship.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03507.png\'><br>34:40 Shaelyn Hanes: ​The imagery of industrial revolution may be linked with Minh-ha’s engagement of digital technology.<br>34:51 Shaelyn Hanes: ​“two historical moments of great change in our experience and understanding of relations between time and space as they have been, and continue to be, inscribed in cinematic practice.”<br>37:37 Emily Markert: ​\"Nights are not made for the masses\" - This is a quote from Rainer Maria Rilke. There are many hidden quotations such as this throughout the film, evidenced in the script.<br>38:33 Emily Markert: ​Minh-ha describes this character as: “She’s only this empty sound vessel through which [words] manifest themselves in leaps, bounces, and bursts.”<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03508.png\'><br>40:02 Emily Markert: ​Minh-ha thinks of \"language being literally a body’s and a people’s music” and she is deeply interested in rhythm.<br>43:37 Shaelyn Hanes: ​This scene shows sculpture Joseph Slusky improvising and performing himself.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03510.png\'><br>43:55 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Minh-ha, whose work often challenges the separation of art and documentary film, notes ​“these largely unscripted or at times self-scripted interventions constitute the documentary parts of Night Passage.”<br>44:54 Emily Markert: ​I wonder what happened to the piece after this shoot...<br>46:32 VIEWER: ​Were these sculptures commissioned specially for the film? Or are they his existing pieces?<br>47:31 Emily Markert: ​Created for the film, if I\'m not mistaken.<br>47:48 VIEWER: ​Neat!<br>48:36 Emily Markert: ​This is one of the few scenes that is lifted directly from Night on the Galactic Railroad.<br>51:50 Shaelyn Hanes: ​The song just sang was pulled from a pom, Song of the Exiled, by Alicia Partnoy, a political prisoner during Argentine military dictatorship.<br>53:34 Emily Markert: ​\"Die, Dissolve, Disappear: the three D’s.\" This line articulates Minh-ha\'s thinking about Night Passage as a whole.<br><br>53:40 Emily Markert: ​In fact, a book all about Night Passage, which contains many of the above quotes, is titled D-Passage in reference to this line.<br>53:59 Emily Markert: ​The \"D\" also refers to Digital in this context.<br>54:18 Shaelyn Hanes: ​“Remember the rules of night passage. Don’t stop in the dark or you’ll be lost. Move to the rhythm of your senses. Go where the road is alive.” This line evokes a famous Zen koan.<br>54:28 Shaelyn Hanes: ​The student is given a lit candle after telling his master, “it’s dark outside.” As the student is about to take the candle, the master blows it out, sparking a deep realization in the student.<br>54:29 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Minh-ha notes that both of these stories lead her to travel and darkness.<br>55:27 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Notice that Nabi allows herself to play in the water here, while Kyra is careful to follow the stone path.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03513.png\'><br>58:40 Shaelyn Hanes: ​This scene shows twins performing a classical Indian dance that has been adapted to depict water. The dance harkens to “the flow of life, the struggle with the double and with death.”<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03511.png\'><br>59:26 Emily Markert: ​Although a fictional film, this section shows a series of real traditional dances.<br>59:57 Emily Markert: ​In Minh-ha\'s words: \"In their conception and choreography, the dances form another instance of the transcultural…​The singular image that emerges from the passage between Eastern and Western traditions is a trajectory of fire that turns into light calligraphy.\"<br>1:00:32 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Here Nabi finds a Wind mask.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03512.png\'><br>1:01:20 Shaelyn Hanes: ​After putting it on and entering into the space of the mask, Nabi encounters a Wind spirit and engages in an intense struggle.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03514.png\'><br>1:02:06 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Kyra saves Nabi by unfurling the red ribbon, which serves as the red thread of life.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03515.png\'><br>1:04:50 Emily Markert: ​They appreciated its representation of \"a multiplicity of forms of coupling, pairing, doubling, and teaming” (which is seen elsewhere in the film, too).<br>1:10:08 Emily Markert: ​The non-linearity of Night Passage is constantly reinforced by the characters moving between \"something\" and \"nothing,\" from light to dark. <br>1:10:53 Emily Markert: Minh-ha writes: ​“The passage in the film from the third to the fourth dimension during nighttime and back is, similarly, one in which a new digital image can be made to arise from the preceding one ​not linearly but from any point within the latter. The new arises anywhere from the old… The journey is indefinitely marked by comings and goings.”<br>1:11:19 Emily Markert: ​In this scene, Tom Zummer and Sherman Kennedy play “themselves” while adapting the roles of Uncle Borges and Dr. Kennedy, largely improvising the dialogues.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03516.png\'><br>1:11:24 Emily Markert: ​The themes they discuss (and Uncle Borges\'s name) directly reference Jorge Luis Borges’s vision of immortality as depicted in his short story \"The Immortal\" from 1947.<br><br>1:11:56 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Note that they are in the “House of Immortals” — an important reference for determining where Kyra and Nabi are in their journey.<br>1:12:22 Shaelyn Hanes: ​The robot’s humanity is signaled by its ability to smoke a cigar - a reference to Freud, who was a prolific cigar smoker.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03517.png\'><br>1:13:42 Emily Markert: ​Despite these references, the scene is also forward-looking in its focus on technology.<br>1:13:49 Emily Markert: ​As explained by Minh-ha: \"these light squares speak of the \'no-image\' frames digitally produced in the computer, freed of reference and freed from representation.\"<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03518.png\'><br>1:14:27 VIEWER: ​the squares of light also remind one of the train<br>1:14:52 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Very true!<br>1:17:37 Emily Markert: ​Here is another transparent acknowledgment of the filmmaker and her mechanisms, like the earlier soundboards.<br>1:19:24 Emily Markert: ​It is worth noting now that death and the concept of Christian heaven are major themes in Night on the Galactic Railroad.<br>1:19:50 Emily Markert: ​However, Minh-ha eschews these specific ideas in her reimagining of the story.<br>1:20:42 Shaelyn Hanes: ​The struggle of these two dancers performs a death by drowning, one that mirrors Nabi’s own struggle. According to the script, “through the dance, Nabi witnesses her own death.”<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03519.png\'><br>1:23:29 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Back on the train, we are reminded that the journey is at the core of this story, which Minh-ha has also compared to the practice of the Middle Way in Buddhism.<br>1:23:38 Shaelyn Hanes: ​“Practicing the Middle Way does not mean being halfway... On the contrary, the middle is where there’s no duality, no leaning on one side or the other, hence no foreclosures due to barriers.”<br>1:25:03 Emily Markert: ​Recall Nabi appeared on the train wet.<br>1:25:11 Emily Markert: ​\"Rather than ascending to [heaven], the two young women enter the night to meet their own earthly dreams.\"<br>1:28:14 Emily Markert: ​Although not \"heaven\" per se, the world that Kyra and Nabi just inhabited together is described by Minh-ha as one of \"the eccentric and the departed.\" Now Kyra is \"back\" and alone.<br>1:30:21 Emily Markert: ​Like the beginning of the film, this ending is a direct reference to Night on the Galactic Railroad.<br>1:32:01 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Once again we see Kyra’s red thread of life, which she employs in order to try to summon Nabi back to life. While the ribbon disrupted Nabi’s struggle with the Wind spirit before, it is of no use now.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03520.png\'><br>1:32:18 Emily Markert: ​We will leave you with Minh-ha’s words on death:<br>1:32:26 Emily Markert: ​\"If death is untimely, then it seems that one can’t help but be untimely. It may thus be said that in living the present, one is always slightly ahead or slightly behind. ​In today’s world...in which globalization fights globalization, it may be particularly relevant that D-cinema be a way of intimately addressing our mortality…​with filmmaking as a way of assuming our insecure path of freedom.\"<br>1:33:38 CCA Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts: ​Thank you so much for joining us.

This haiku will appear again later in the film.<br>6:51 Emily Markert: ​Trinh was born in Hanoi, Vietnam and has been based in the United States since 1970.<br>7:00 Emily Markert: ​By narrating this documentary in her own voice, she is able to question her authority as a non-Japanese person ostensibly appropriating images of Japanese culture.<br>7:14 Emily Markert: ​Trinh has spoken and written extensively on this precarious position. About The Fourth Dimension specifically, she explained:<br>7:19 Emily Markert: ​“When you decide to speak nearby, rather than speak about, the first thing you need to do is to acknowledge the possible gap between you and those who populate your film…in other words, to leave the space of representation open so that, although you’re very close to your subject, you’re also committed to not speaking on their behalf, in their place or on top of them. Such an approach gives freedom to both sides and this may account for it being taken up by filmmakers who recognize in it a strong ethical stance.”<br>8:35 Shaelyn Hanes ​Similar to Night Passage, The Fourth Dimension is a film that situates itself between fiction, documentary, and experimental film.<br>8:44 Shaelyn Hanes: ​While the improvised scenes in Night Passage constituted the documentary, Trinh notes that The Fourth Dimension is intended to be a documentary of time. She writes:<br>8:51 Shaelyn Hanes: ​“The documentary aspect…has less to do with the nonstaged nature of the material shot than with the process of documenting its own unfolding: it documents its own time, its creation in megahertz, the different paths and layers of time-light that are involved in the production of images and meanings.”<br>10:21 Emily Markert: ​You may associate the term “fourth dimension” with math or physics. Trinh describes “the fourth dimension of cinema” as time, not just in terms of the length of a film, but in the film’s content.<br>10:28 Emily Markert: ​This film in particular layers “musical, historical, sociopolitical time, as well as...the time of festivities, of traveling, of witnessing, and of viewing,” for example.<br>10:36 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Trinh also notes that in the context of spiritual practice, “the fourth dimension” can refer to the dimension of light within (not in opposition to) darkness.<br>10:53 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Darkness was a theme addressed in Night Passage, as well.<br>12:27 Shaelyn Hanes: ​There are two main “characters” in The Fourth Dimension, which correlate with the most powerful rhythms Trinh experienced while living in Japan.<br>12:36 Shaelyn Hanes: ​These are: “the train, as it regulates time (the time of traveling and of viewing); and the drum, as it is the beat of (our) life (significantly played by women in the film).”<br>12:47 Emily Markert: ​In Night Passage, we see the female protagonist travel through space and time on a train while she is dreaming. Is this sleeping woman dreaming of her own fantastical train ride?<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03556.png\'><br>13:54 CCA Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts: ​By the way, if you\'ve just joined us, you can skip back to the beginning of this stream to watch the film from the start. You’ll still see our ongoing chat, though.<br>14:01 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Notice how Trinh emphasizes “the lightness and portability of the camera” in this shot and throughout the film, calling attention to the process of production.<br>14:06 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Speaking of The Fourth Dimension, she notes that “the movement of a camera carried on the shoulder is very different from that of a camera held in the palm of one’s hand.”<br>15:46 Emily Markert: ​Japan’s \"bullet\" trains, the Shinkansen, are emblematic of the rapid and unprecedented technological and economic development that has taken place there since World War II.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03557.png\'><br>15:56 Emily Markert: ​The first Shinkansen tracks opened in 1964.<br>18:08 Emily Markert: ​Part of Trinh’s goal with this film was to “locate rites and rituals not only in the obvious places, in festivals and ceremonies, but also in everyday life.”<br>18:20 Emily Markert: ​As we oscillate between public spaces and private interiors, consider how the word “ritual” applies to the various scenes.<br>20:12 Emily Markert: ​Some other questions to consider in scenes like this one include: Who is the true audience of this performance--who are they performing for? What does it mean for Trinh to be filming it?<br>21:35 Emily Markert: ​The red squares overlaid here represent the multiplicity of both conceptual and visual framing Trinh witnessed in Japan.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03558.png\'><br>21:42 Emily Markert: ​In one example, she described her observations of Japanese doors and openings as: ​“You come to someone’s home...they proceed to slide the partition doors in intricate shifts of rights and lefts and middles, ​and shuttling in front of you are at least four or five framings of the outdoor garden.”<br>24:38 Emily Markert: ​Japanese bullfighting is called \"togyu\"!<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03559.png\'><br>26:28 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Notice how Trinh speaks in rhythm with the movements of the train in this scene.<br>26:34 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Rhythm is a key element of this film, with Trinh working “with uneven and heterogeneous speeds, rather than with a homogenized space of linear time.”<br>28:37 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Trinh uses ritual as a way of slowing down time and encouraging her viewer to “step out of the one-dimensional, technologically servile mind.”<br>28:42 Shaelyn Hanes: ​These rituals are intended to mark the boundary between past / present, light / dark, outside / inside, form / content.<br>28:48 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Trinh encourages us to enter this boundary and experience “something that opens both ways and allows you simultaneously entrance and exit.”<br>28:53 Shaelyn Hanes: ​This boundary is one of many meanings of “the fourth dimension” for Trinh.<br>29:05 Emily Markert: ​Boundaries, dichotomies, and binaries are interrogated throughout this film, just as they are in Night Passage.<br>29:19 Emily Markert: ​In the latter, the protagonists constantly cross between the train and the private spaces occupied by the other characters. Their journey is shrouded in ambiguity (darkness).<br>29:27 Emily Markert: ​In this film, Trinh is like those protagonists.<br>30:56 Emily Markert: ​These scenes and the narration points to how rituals can be used as a frame “whose stabilizing effect, experienced through repetition in cycles and in rhythmic recurrences allows us to see things with a different intensity.”<br>32:24 Shaelyn Hanes: ​In Night Passage, we saw Trinh revealing the material means of production of the sound of the film. In The Fourth Dimension, we see her pointing to the creative process of filmmaking.<br>32:29 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Notice the layered shapes and colors on top of the image and the presence of colors such as this pink square, or bright red and green alongside one another.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03560.png\'><br>32:35 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Trinh uses these tactics to call our attention to the moiré pattern of the video screen.<br>34:05 VIEWER: ​Can\'t wait for \"Noh time\"<br>34:23 Emily Markert ​Us too, us too<br>34:32 Emily Markert: ​If our modern society is like a train, what does this mean for the linearity of our lives?<br>34:47 Emily Markert: ​It is valuable to consider the context in which The Fourth Dimension was released: April 2001.<br>34:57 Emily Markert: ​Reflecting in 2002, Trinh commented: “We are constantly running for fear that if we stop, time may catch up with us. It’s only in extreme situations, as with the recent 9/11 event, that suddenly the arrow of time loses its forward-only linearity to take on a multi-spiral course.”<br>37:30 Emily Markert: ​It\'s Noh time!<br>37:37 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Here again, we see Trinh using color layered on top of the image as a way of drawing our attention to the texture of the screen.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03561.png\'><br>37:50 Emily Markert: ​Noh is a form of classical Japanese dance-drama dating back to the 14th century.<br>37:54 Emily Markert: ​Traditionally, the stage is open save for a roof, to create a sense of shared experience between the audience and performers.<br>38:00 Emily Markert: ​Here, the color block does the opposite, as if asking: is it possible to view traditional artforms through anything but our 21st century lens?<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03562.png\'><br>38:41 Emily Markert: ​Rituals as depicted in The Fourth Dimension represent both conformity and freedom. For Trinh, even youth rave culture is characterized as a kind of “tribalism.”<br>38:49 Emily Markert: ​“We can’t see into the other face of rituals when we indulge in divisive realities and compartmentalized knowledge​...To ignore, to isolate, to naturalize or to take for granted the very rituals that define our activities would amount to letting conformity reign.”<br>40:07 Emily Markert: ​The dichotomy between “guest” and “host” Trinh describes here relates to the binaries or boundaries we mentioned earlier.<br>40:18 Emily Markert: ​Not only does “guest” and “host” describe Trinh’s own presence in Japan creating The Fourth Dimension, but it also describes filmmaking itself.<br>40:25 Emily Markert: ​The medium and the maker act as both host and guest in relation to the content of footage of Japan.<br>40:36 Emily Markert: ​There is a constant pull between care and control in this relationship, as with the relationship between a guest and a host in a private home.<br>40:50 Emily Markert: ​There is a connection here to speed, too. Visitors, especially “tourists,” often don’t want to “take the time” to understand the boundaries and traditions of the space they have entered.<br>42:19 Shaelyn Hanes: ​For some Japanese novelists, “the fourth dimension” is used in reference to a “dimension of reality not immediately perceptible through ‘normal’ sight.”<br>42:25 Shaelyn Hanes: ​One must lose their “normal eye” in order to experience this fourth dimension.<br>42:54 VIEWER: ​There are many zooms in and out in the video and I am curious about this. Slow and fast zooms.<br>43:55 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Yes! This demonstrates Trinh\'s interest in the portable digital camera. We will see her use this as a way of emphasizing its lightness and the space between tradition and modernity.<br>44:17 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Trinh’s approach to slowness is not opposed to speed, for “stillness contains speed and determines its quality.”<br>44:27 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Considering this in relation to the digital, Trinh writes, “Speed at its best in digital imaging is still speed. The speed of a flower mind.”<br>45:08 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Here is an example of Trinh using the mobility of the handheld camera to trace shots “between two realms that are habitually conceived as separate” by panning between the scene of traditional performance and the surrounding modern crowd, many of whom watch with digital cameras in hand.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03563.png\'><br>47:55 Emily Markert: ​I find this music particularly beautiful. We will talk more about the musicality of this film shortly.<br>48:31 Shaelyn Hanes: ​The torii gate symbolically marks the transition from the mundane to the sacred.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03564.png\'><br>48:38 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Consider this in relation to how Trinh describes ritual as marking a boundary and allowing one to step into a revolving door between entrance and exit.<br>49:52 Emily Markert: ​The script of The Fourth Dimension reveals that Trinh’s narration consists largely of quotations from writers and thinkers from throughout history, most of which are not cited like this one.<br>49:57 Emily Markert: ​Trinh also weaves quotations and allusions into Night Passage in this subtle way.<br>50:55 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Trinh uses slowness throughout this film in a way that is both subversive and rooted in her working process with the digital. She writes:<br>51:00 Shaelyn Hanes: ​“In times of coercive politics and transnational terror, slowing down so as to learn to listen anew is a necessity. For me this is particularly relevant, as I turn to digital systems in my last two films, The Fourth Dimension and Night Passage. ​For the question is not so much to produce a new image as to provoke, to facilitate and to solicit a new seeing.”<br>53:12 Emily Markert: ​This explicit focus on “Women’s Time” speaks to Trinh’s interest in and study of feminist theory.<br>53:18 Emily Markert: ​For more on this, consider consulting her important book entitled Woman, Native, Other: Writing Postcoloniality and Feminism.<br>53:38 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Trinh writes that “Women’s Time” potentially defines Japan’s Time by finding space “in the heart of an insular culture” for “invisible narrators...uneven times and odd rhythms.”<br>55:20 Emily Markert: ​Consider that much of the music in this film is being performed in front of us, rather than playing as a score on top of the footage.<br>1:00:17 Emily Markert: ​Matsuo Bashō (1644-1694) is quoted multiple times in The Fourth Dimension and is a major historical and literary figure.<br>1:00:21 Emily Markert: ​He is best known for his haiku poems and collaborative renku, which contain many linked haikai verses.<br>1:00:32 Emily Markert: ​Bashō walked and wrote about the world he observed. He was more interested in communicating an experience than obeying the rules of the poetic form.<br>1:00:40 Emily Markert: ​One could describe Trinh’s approach to documentary filmmaking in this same way.<br>1:00:51 Emily Markert: ​Additionally, Trinh has written extensively about walking as it relates to bodily experiences of time and history, as well as performing presence or knowledge.<br>1:02:13 Shaelyn Hanes: ​This scene demonstrates what Trinh has identified as the “three textual layers” of her work – the visual text, the musical text, and the verbal text.<br>1:02:20 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Of the verbal text, she notes further layers: one that relates to the subject (here, Japan) and one that speaks to “the unfolding process of producing images and meanings.”<br>1:02:26 Shaelyn Hanes: ​This way of speaking allows Trinh to speak to the “how” of the scene rather than the “what.” She writes: ​“And by doing so, it questions its own politics of representation and positions the filmmaker. I’m constantly exposing where I stand.”<br>1:02:55 Emily Markert: ​Breaking the fourth wall... but documentary-style<br>1:04:50 Emily Markert: ​This film predates social media, but what Trinh describes here sounds very much like a description of the function of social media to me.<br>1:07:39 Shaelyn Hanes: ​This portion of the film, which consists mostly of voyeuristic scenes of both banal and extraordinary events without Trinh’s narration, exemplifies her use of images as an unfolding “time-form (that) allow us to experience not motion, but time as a form of its own.”<br>1:08:31 Emily Markert: ​Whenever Japanese is spoken in The Fourth Dimension, we are invited to consider its musicality by hearing its rhythm and undulations, rather than simply understanding its meaning.<br>1:08:36 Emily Markert: ​Trinh has said: “Although my films can all be said to be music of the eye, [The Fourth Dimension] stands out for me both as a spectrum of time and a musical latticework.”<br>1:08:50 Emily Markert: ​The character of Aunt Wolf in Night Passage also represents Trinh’s interest in the musicality of language and how the body acts as a musical instrument to create it.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03508.png\'><br>1:10:07 Emily Markert: ​Suddenly, this both looks and sounds much more like a traditional documentary.<br>1:10:13 Emily Markert: ​Of course, Trinh often eschews this categorization of her films as she prefers to locate her work across categories and boundaries; in a space of multiplicity.<br>1:13:03 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Trinh places her tactic of “speaking nearby” within Frantz Fanon’s three phases of colonized cultural identity, as outlined in his book, The Wretched of the Earth.<br>1:13:10 Shaelyn Hanes: ​She writes, “…with, across and in between: it is the phase of struggle. You can borrow the master’s tools, as long as you know that you are merely borrowing for strategic purposes.”<br>1:13:17 Shaelyn Hanes: ​While Japan was never colonized, this framework relates to her analysis of Japan’s relationship to the West.<br>1:15:45 Emily Markert: ​Trinh’s use of “essential” here to describe the workers who are “natives, exiled, and immigrants discriminated against” feels especially potent from our current vantage point, especially in the US.<br>1:15:59 Emily Markert: ​The Covid-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted marginalized communities who often hold jobs sometimes described as “unskilled labor” and now deemed “essential.”<br>1:18:14 Emily Markert: ​The Fourth Dimension is exactly 86 minutes 40 seconds long as this was, in 2001, the longest time acceptable for a mainstream TV broadcast in the US.<br>1:18:24 Emily Markert: ​This was a tongue-in-cheek decision on Trinh’s part as the film centers on our obsession with efficiency, mobility, and speed.<br>1:18:38 VIEWER: ​Noh times two, noh?<br>1:19:33 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Indeed! Here Trinh juxtaposes modernity with tradition by inlaying a scene of Noh theater, the oldest surviving form of Japanese theatre, on top of the linear journey along a train track.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03565.png\'><br>1:19:42 Shaelyn Hanes: ​This also speaks to her interest in the screen as it relates to life, performance, and film.<br>1:25:32 Emily Markert: ​The Japanese word “ma” is often translated as negative space. However, ma is better understood as a space (physical or conceptual) in which dissimilar things can co-exist.<br>1:25:40 Emily Markert: ​Here we can think of it in terms of 21st century Japan and our conceptions of it.<br>1:25:49 Emily Markert: ​The Fourth Dimension asks us to see Japan’s many dimensions and “to recognize the multiplicity of times at work in any single moment of the journey.”<br>1:29:08 CCA Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts: ​Thank you for joining us!

We hope you’ll come back for A Tale of Love next week to see how.<br>4:46 Shaelyn Hanes: ​The title of this film is lifted from a quotation from Vietnamese anticolonial nationalist Phan Bội Châu (1867-1940).<br>4:52 Shaelyn Hanes: ​He is known to have said that an unmarried woman needed to identify her marital status by saying, “My surname is Việt, given name is Nam.”<br>5:02 Shaelyn Hanes: ​To quote film & media scholar Lan P. Duong, Trinh’s use of this phrase “reveals how the Vietnamese female subject is not only caught in the heteronormative binds of the family and the nation but also that she holds no singular identity.”<br>5:16 Shaelyn Hanes: ​The multiplicity of Vietnamese women’s roles and identities on an individual and national level is a key subject of this film.<br>5:26 Emily Markert: ​We will see this particular archival footage clip a few times, but as with Night Passage and The Fourth Dimension, Trinh does not use archival images in Surname Viet to construct a linear timeline.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03567.png\'><br>5:35 Emily Markert: ​They simply lend context. The footage mostly comes from the 1950s.<br>6:01 Emily Markert: As you can see, Surname Viet does not start with a single event or “establishing shot,” nor an authoritative voice. Where are we? When are we?<br>7:10 Shaelyn Hanes: ​You may feel like these subtitles are flashing by too fast, or faster than you are used to. This is deliberate, of course.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03568.png\'><br>7:15 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Trinh is asking us to question the role of and importance of subtitles as a cinematic apparatus, as well as the type of hierarchical worldview bold-faced English subtitles represent.<br>7:48 Emily Markert:​A mainstream film tries to hide its artifices and structures. In Trinh’s words, tools like subtitles represent an attempt to “protect the unity of the subject…to collapse...reading, hearing and seeing into one single activity, as if they were all the same. ​My desire, on the contrary, is to ‘unsew’ them and to present them as three distinct activities endowed with a certain degree of autonomy.”<br>8:04 Emily Markert: ​Keep this in mind as the film continues.<br>8:50 Shaelyn Hanes: ​You might be having a bit of trouble understanding every word this woman is saying. That is actually intentional.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03569.png\'><br>8:55 Shaelyn Hanes: ​She speaks in English with a heavy Vietnamese accent, sometimes mispronouncing things. John Mowitt calls these “linguistic antagonisms.” No subtitles appear on-screen.<br>9:04 Shaelyn Hanes: ​What does this do to our perception of the accuracy and legibility of translation?<br>13:57 Emily Markert: ​Here is that archival clip repeated. The woman speaking is describing events from the 1970s, but, again, the footage is from the 1950s.<br>14:07 Emily Markert: ​And once again, hearing and seeing are autonomous events.<br>14:14 Emily Markert: ​In Trinh’s words: “what seems more important to me is the specific nature of the problems women of many times and many places have to undergo—as women.”<br>14:42 Shaelyn Hanes: ​This speaker’s accent is also quite thick, and we are seeing an unexpectedly fragmented view of her.<br>14:50 Shaelyn Hanes: ​These are a few of the ways Trinh subverts the documentary interview form throughout the first half of the film. These Vietnamese women are presented not just as elusive but perhaps unknowable.<br>14:59 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Using close-ups of this kind, Trinh prevents objectification of the women in the name of nationalism or exoticization by the West.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03570.png\'><br>17:34 Emily Markert: ​Last week we spoke a lot about binaries in The Fourth Dimension.<br>17:50 Emily Markert: ​Here Trinh mentions beginnings and endings as another type of binary.<br>17:57 Emily Markert: ​Consider what the black-and-white archival footage evokes or implies in this sense.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03571.png\'><br>18:03 Emily Markert: ​Documentary versus fiction; objective versus subjective; authentic versus fake.<br>20:28 Shaelyn Hanes: ​This, of course, refers both to these literal male figures and the nation of Vietnam.<br>20:34 Shaelyn Hanes: ​The use of English and Vietnamese thus far in the film points to the fact that the roles and expectations of Vietnamese women we are seeing and hearing about do not just apply to women in Vietnam but also diasporic Vietnamese women, especially those who live in America.<br>20:54 Emily Markert: ​Consider how male-centric the American narrative and mythology of Vietnam is—largely because it is centered on an event, rather than a place or society.<br>20:59 Emily Markert: ​This film offers a feminist counter to that narrative, and the oppression of women in the US, as *well* as the oppressive patriarchy at work in the country of Vietnam.<br><br>22:06 Shaelyn Hanes: ​The speaker just mentioned she is from South Vietnam. Trinh made sure that the three regions of Vietnam (North, South, Center) were represented by the speakers.<br>22:11 Shaelyn Hanes: ​They are from different geographic as well as linguistic backgrounds. (You may detect that the women’s accents differ slightly.)<br>23:12 Emily Markert: ​Notice that each woman has been filmed wearing fairly plain, modest clothing, without makeup or jewelry.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03572.png\'><br>23:16 Emily Markert: ​The backgrounds, when visible, do not distract, and feel quite staged, as we might expect a documentary interview scene to look.<br>24:53 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Between the speaker, the singer, and the subtitles, we are affronted here with three layers of the film at once. We see and hear English, but also Vietnamese.<br>24:58 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Trinh has said: “Translation seeks faithfulness and accuracy and ends up always betraying either the letter of the text, its spirit, or its aesthetics.”<br>25:06 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Do you see these three threads as collaborating, weaving the story of the documentary together, or unraveling it?<br>26:50 Emily Markert: ​Even this narrative-within-a-film is unable to proceed in a linear way as we miss portions of her monologue.<br>26:58 Emily Markert: ​Now, the Vietnamese song seems to drown out the speaker, but with the subtitles, Trinh can focus our attention on the songs’ content as well as or instead of their musicality.<br>27:03 Emily Markert: ​This is a markedly different approach from her later films, such as The Fourth Dimension.<br>27:09 Emily Markert: ​The lyrics tend to reflect traditional Vietnamese gender roles.<br>27:50 VIEWER: ​Are there supposed to be subtitles?<br>28:13 Emily Markert: ​Periodically -- not throughout.<br>28:28 VIEWER: ​Thank you for the clarification<br>29:56 Shaelyn Hanes: ​In an interview after a screening of Surname Viet, Trinh recalled a time a translator at a film festival in Paris came to her panicked.<br>30:02 Shaelyn Hanes: ​She didn’t know how to translate Trinh’s films into French because they often contain multiple languages simultaneously.<br>30:10 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Trinh forced the woman to simply make a decision, ostensibly asking her to experience first-hand the very problems of translation this film tries to depict.<br>30:30 Emily Markert: ​In addition to the title quote from Phan Bội Châu and the folk songs, Trinh cites other figures from Vietnamese history and literature throughout the film.<br>30:36 Emily Markert: ​They all relate to traditional gender roles and Vietnamese society’s expectations of women.<br>30:42 Emily Markert: ​Here she describes Nguyễn Du\'s Tale of Kiều, which is also the central inspiration for our next film, A Tale of Love.<br>30:56 Emily Markert: ​However, Trinh also includes quotations from female writers from the 18th and 19th century in Surname Viet.<br>31:02 Emily Markert: ​The purpose of this is to show that feminist ideas also have historical precedent, especially in the face of what is deemed \"traditional.\"<br>31:42 Emily Markert: ​I love that Paris film festival anecdote 🙂<br>32:33 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Even though we cannot see her face, we can tell that the speaker, Thu Van, is looking directly at the camera in a brightly-lit space, unlike the other two speakers.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03573.png\'><br>32:47 Shaelyn Hanes: ​She confronts our gaze while Trinh works with her to distract or subvert it. This is an ongoing theme we will address in our screening of A Tale of Love next week.<br>33:06 Emily Markert: ​This rare moment of cohesion, with the subtitles matching the audio, may strike you as surprising.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03574.png\'><br>33:19 Emily Markert: ​Suddenly it is clear that the film has damaged our faith in the system of subtitles, which we typically consider authoritative and reliable.<br>33:41 Emily Markert: ​And we\'re only 30 minutes in!<br>34:02 Emily Markert: ​In Trinh’s words: “interviews which occupy a dominant role in documentary practices—in terms of authenticating information;<br>34:08 Emily Markert: ​validating the voices recruited for the sake of the argument the film advances;<br>34:14 Emily Markert: ​and legitimizing an exclusionary system of representation based on the dominant ideology of presence and authenticity —are actually sophisticated devices of fiction.<br>34:42 Emily Markert: ​She has also said: “Every documentary practice fundamentally involves elements of fiction, just as every good fiction film has a profound documentary quality to it.”<br>36:27 Shaelyn Hanes: ​As words invade the frame occupied by Thu Van, consider how women’s bodies are themselves sites of translation.<br>36:36 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Women move seamlessly from role to role in society.<br>36:47 Shaelyn Hanes: ​And here, Thu Van speaks in English about experiences in Vietnam, literally translating herself.<br>38:44 Emily Markert: ​Consider the differences you perceive between the narrator (Trinh) and the on-screen speakers.<br>39:00 Emily Markert: ​In reality, much of her narration is lifted from interviews with women who we simply do not see.<br>39:23 Emily Markert: ​One scholar has contended that the use of storytelling throughout this film “acknowledge[s] the craft of construction and delivery, the pleasures of interchange, the biases of the teller, and the moral or lesson unmistakably transmitted.”<br>41:29 Shaelyn Hanes: ​This list of names creates a kind of historical timeline in the form of language, but also speaks to the film’s title, and how people, especially women, attempt to name and rename their own culture.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03575.png\'><br>41:33 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Control of one’s own names and narratives stands in stark contrast to the structures of colonialism.<br>43:09 Emily Markert: ​You may notice that the interviews are becoming increasingly stylized, here with dramatic lighting, which emphasizes that we are inside, as opposed to the footage we just saw.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03576.png\'><br>43:29 Emily Markert: ​What is “real” and what is “staged”?<br>43:57 Emily Markert: ​This binary breaks down over the course of the film.<br>45:10 Emily Markert: ​To quote writer Susan Pui San Lok: “Frequent lighting and \'prop\' changes within otherwise bare interiors foreground the simple manipulations by which ​a private/domestic and public/professional space, and associated notions of intimacy/subjectivity and distance /objectivity, might be simultaneously evoked and undermined. As \'props\', including clothes, seem to oscillate between function and metaphor, so settings hover between naturalism and abstraction, their very neutrality giving rise to ambiguity.\'”<br>48:02 Shaelyn Hanes: ​As Trinh talks of the sun, she is actually quoting an outside source.<br>48:09 Shaelyn Hanes: ​The temporality of the narrator is constantly in flux.<br>48:16 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Is she telling us stories from the perspective of the present, or is she also recounting memories?<br>49:28 Emily Markert: ​Here, the audio and image are deliberately out of sync. These women are sites of translation, but also sites of memory. The performance of this particular memory seems hazy.<br>50:26 Emily Markert: ​Consider Trinh’s words on memory: “Language used in excess, both via the spoken and the written word, has an effect almost like that of memory: something that is triggered despite yourself.<br>50:32 Emily Markert: ​And knowledge in its ready-made assertions makes it very difficult to come back to a place of beginner’s wonder – unlike the outsider who can often encounter things ​as if for the first time.... But how to become a stranger in your own culture, your own territory, your own home?”<br>54:34 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Despite the age of this citation, this sentiment still rings true as a feminist idea today.<br>56:33 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Consider the power dynamics at play as the woman alludes the man\'s gaze while peering back at him.<br>58:03 Emily Markert: ​If these words do not identically match what is being said, should we still consider them subtitles?<br>58:31 Emily Markert: ​This comment about Vietnamese women not easily “unburdening” themselves lends new meaning to the earlier moment when another speaker speaks directly to the camera and says, “I will talk to you.”<br>58:42 Emily Markert: ​Trinh\'s focus on women who support other people–especially other women–emphasizes their collective agency and privileges collaboration.<br>58:50 Emily Markert: ​This is also Trinh\'s preferred method for filmmaking: collaborating with composers, writers, actors.<br>1:02:07 Emily Markert: ​And here, as Anh looks into the camera, she signals a break from the memory or identity she has been performing through her words and the props she has removed from her body.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03577.png\'><br>1:02:15 Emily Markert: ​She is the subject of the camera’s gaze, but has the power and volition to disrupt its format with her own.<br>1:02:29 Emily Markert: ​(The format of the traditional documentary.)<br>1:03:43 Shaelyn Hanes: ​The predictability of the documentary interview format is continuing to break down in front of us, as this speaker paces in front of us, not looking at the camera.<br>1:07:55 Emily Markert: ​Here Trinh is being interviewed by an off-screen narrator named Lan Trinh, a second-generation Vietnamese American.<br>1:08:02 Emily Markert: ​In this way, Trinh makes clear her role in creating the film as a translator herself. This move is part of her overall critique of the authenticity and authorship of the documentary form.<br>1:08:27 Emily Markert: ​You may be wondering, why did Trinh interview 150 women only to show us about five?<br>1:08:35 Emily Markert: ​Well, the interviews we have seen were actually scripted, lifted from a book entitled Vietnam: un peuple, des voix.<br>1:08:44 Emily Markert: ​This book, by Mai Thu Vân, was published in 1983. It contains interviews with Vietnamese women that Mai conducted in Vietnamese, and then translated into French.<br>1:08:55 Emily Markert: ​Trinh translated a selection of these interviews into English for this film. This is why some of the “subtitles”, pulled from the book, did not match the audio, which was interpreted by the speakers.<br>1:09:11 Emily Markert: ​Thus the big reveal: The women on screen did not live through the experiences they so far recounted. However, they did experience similar things growing up at the same time as the women interviewed.<br>1:10:11 Shaelyn Hanes: ​As we have seen through the interviews and the archival footage, women’s clothing constitutes a major thread woven through this film.<br>1:11:49 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Here we see the children dressed in áo dài, a Vietnamese national garment<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03578.png\'><br>1:13:00 Emily Markert: ​The microphones are now picking up not just the woman speaking, but also the ambient sounds as she eats a meal with other people, conducting her daily life.<br>1:13:11 Emily Markert: ​This scene does not match our expectations of the “truthful” or “authoritative” documentary interview. And yet, it feels far more authentic than the staged interviews we saw earlier.<br>1:15:10 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Trinh writes: “These interviews in which a camera and a microphone are set up to catch the \"spontaneous words\" of a woman while she is having lunch, for example, are no less staged than the reenacted ones; but now the \"staging\" may be taken more for granted by the viewer, it\'s more hidden, concealed, because it is no longer perceptible via the mise en scene or the language, but more via the situating, framing, editing and contextualizing.”<br>1:19:38 Emily Markert: ​Here is another instance where we see layers of time collapsing. This woman speaks to us now (meaning 1989) of her mother who by the 70s had already experienced “fleeing on foot” at least once.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03579.png\'><br>1:20:35 Emily Markert: ​There women\'s lived experiences reflect a larger legacy of colonialism and patriarchal authority in Vietnam.<br>1:21:41 Emily Markert:​ This dialogue between two young girls brings a new interview dynamic to the fore.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03580.png\'><br>1:21:53 Emily Markert: ​Their conversation invites us to consider how amicable, intimate conversations might be more honest and authentic than formal interviews.<br>1:24:32 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Here Trinh is quoting Mai Thu Vân.<br>1:24:37 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Many essays on this film consider Mai’s text nothing more than an inspiration, but Trinh would have us read the film as collaborative, decentralizing her ownership and authorship of the “script.”<br>1:24:45 Shaelyn Hanes: ​As she explains, Mai had difficulty getting Vietnam: un peuple, des voix published in France without a preface by Simone De Beauvoir.<br>1:24:52 Shaelyn Hanes: ​For Mai and Trinh, this emblematized how Western ideas of feminism remained hegemonic rather than intersectional.<br>1:26:38 Emily Markert: ​You may think a beauty pageant stands in opposition to the feminist values and desires for female empowerment and volition we have heard until this point.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03581.png\'><br>1:26:54 Emily Markert: ​Trinh talks about how she struggled to depict this scene critically but without condemning the women: “It seems important to be caring at the same time as one is critical.<br>1:27:01 Emily Markert: ​That\'s something I find most difficult in working on this film. ...Can a critique also be a compliment without being any less of a critique?”<br>1:27:20 Shaelyn Hanes: ​“The three obediences and four virtues” are a set of moral principles coded behaviours for young women in Confucianism.<br>1:28:49 Emily Markert: ​Here we continue to see the same women who spoke in starkly lit, stylized rooms earlier in the film in their daily lives.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03582.png\'><br>1:29:02 Emily Markert: ​According to Trinh, “To push the limits of self-representation a bit further, the second, and even more so the third, parts of the film are organized around ‘documented’ scenes ​that materialize the choices the women made when , as a structural device, I asked each of them how they would like to see themselves represented.”<br>1:29:17 Emily Markert: ​This freedom is also reflected in their clothing and makeup choices.<br>1:30:18 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Filmmaker Isaac Julien responded to the contrast of the women’s attire and their choices around self-representation by saying: “That\'s very interesting, because for me that’s about desire, and wanting to fictionalize yourself in a particular way, because to a certain extent they realize they want to present themselves in a way that may be different from the way they may be every day. Because it\'s a special experience.”<br>1:30:45 Shaelyn Hanes: ​In either case, the presence of the camera drives us to present ourselves in a certain, perhaps inauthentic way; the way we would like to be seen.<br>1:30:54 Shaelyn Hanes: ​These are “differing fictions of living and acting,” in Trinh’s words.<br>1:32:31 Emily Markert: ​Julien and Trinh spoke together at the Wattis in February.<br>1:33:34 Emily Markert: ​As we hear layers of words and music, think of Trinh’s recent remark in a 2018 interview: ​“Nonsense can come with an overload of meaning: you can hear the sound of a word rather than its intended meaning.”<br>1:35:08 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Seeing these women in the United States, speaking about their experiences in Vietnamese, in their own clothes and homes and workspaces, creates a doubling effect.<br>1:35:19 Shaelyn Hanes: ​We saw the same women earlier speaking English as they spoke about Vietnam. In place of dialectical binaries, which Trinh often uses, here we face a mirror.<br>1:36:08 Emily Markert: ​Trinh’s continued use of close-up shots and layers of audio speaks to how the film demonstrates the fragmented ways Vietnamese women are composed and imagined in nationalist discourse.<br>1:36:31 Emily Markert: ​Especially here, towards, the end, as they speak in Vietnamese.<br>1:40:53 Emily Markert: ​The joyous wedding and this energetic, joyful scene contrast the negative, pervasive authority of husbands and fathers described earlier in the film.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03583.png\'><br>1:41:21 Emily Markert: ​We are seeing these women enjoy a level of liberation from authoritarian, patriarchal structures through their ability to be “themselves,” or at least use their voices to tell us about themselves.<br>1:41:38 Emily Markert: ​As Susan Pui San Lok writes, “Trinh’s camera not only demonstrates how the women look at spectacles but also reveals their pleasure in being spectacles themselves.”<br>1:42:21 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Trinh writes: “the notion of displacement is also a place of identity: there is no real me to return to, no whole self that synthesizes the woman, the woman of colour and the writer; instead, diverse recognitions of self through difference, and unfinished, contingent, arbitrary closures that make possible both politics and identity.”<br>1:43:15 Emily Markert: ​Susan Pui San Lok has also remarked that the film \"demonstrates the insistent designation of Vietnamese women at the intersection of gender and nation, in terms of subordination ​to father, son, husband, state — never fully witnessing, only glorified as heroines or victimized as bystanders of, spectators to, and exiles in their own history.\"<br>1:43:57 Emily Markert: ​Surname Viet was produced just three years after Vietnam’s Đổi Mới Policy was enacted, opening up the state to market capitalism.<br>1:44:05 Emily Markert: ​This caused a major shift in how Vietnam interacted with other nations. In a way, these women’s reflections from 1989 act as a type of time capsule of that moment.<br>1:44:11 Emily Markert: ​The film critiques and captures women\'s roles then.<br>1:45:53 Shaelyn Hanes: ​This list of names for Vietnam again speaks to history and the power of naming.<br>1:45:59 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Who is speaking when you hear each name? Who owns or created each name?<br>1:46:08 Shaelyn Hanes: ​The film speaks to “the feminist necessity to rethink the questions of community, nation, and identity, and to challenge nationalist assumptions of cultural mastery.”<br>1:46:47 Emily Markert: ​Here we revisit footage seen at the beginning Surname Viet.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03584.png\'><br>1:47:24 Emily Markert: ​To end with a quote from Duong: “Since the final frames of the film repeat images of woman-as-nation, there appears to be a cyclical return to the film’s beginning—yet, with a difference.<br>1:47:28 Emily Markert: ​If the film begins with the theatricality of war and the spectacle of womanhood, Surname Viet also shows how the actresses are bound up in this same system of image-making ​but simultaneously attempt to resist it.”<br>1:50:43 CCA Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts: ​Thank you for joining us!

I’m a second year graduate student in CCA’s Curatorial Practice Program and one of the Wattis Curatorial Fellows.<br>0:56 Emily Markert: Hello! I’m Emily. I’m also in the Curatorial Practice graduate program and work alongside Shaelyn as a Curatorial Fellow.<br>1:48 CCA Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts: This is fourth and final screening as part of our Trinh T. Minh-ha Film Club series.<br>[FILM BEGINS AT 4:44]<br>5:18 Shaelyn Hanes: These are the closing lines of The Tale of Kiều, the Vietnamese epic which A Tale of Love is loosely structured around.<br>5:21 Shaelyn Hanes: Written by Nguyễn Du in 1820, The Tale of Kiều is widely considered the most significant work of Vietnamese literature.<br>5:35 Shaelyn Hanes: It tells the tragic story of Vương Thúy Kiều, who gets trapped in a cycle of brothels, men who want to marry her, and enslavement in order to free her family, who were framed.<br>5:42 Shaelyn Hanes: We will hear lines from The Tale of Kiều sung in Vietnamese throughout the film.<br>6:04 Emily Markert: Trinh created this film in 1995, by which time she had well established her reputation as a filmmaker. A Tale of Love was shot on 35mm with equipment donated by Panavision.<br>6:11 Emily Markert: Last week’s film, Surname Viet Given Name Nam (1989), was shot on 16mm with a significantly smaller budget.<br>6:38 Shaelyn Hanes: Here we meet Trinh’s modern day Kiều. Notice that she is behind a veil in this opening scene.<br>6:44 Shaelyn Hanes: Trinh writes, “I would say that in A Tale, more than in my previous films, what is visible and audible can prevent one from seeing and hearing. What continues to elude us is the fact that the image is in itself a veil; so is the ‘dialogue,’ especially when it appears all too obvious at first reception.”<br>8:36 Emily Markert: If you tuned in last week, you know that subtitles are a tool Trinh uses to interrogate ideas of translation and also traditional filmmaking techniques.<br>8:50 Emily Markert: In A Tale of Love, the dialogue is translated for us on-screen, but the story of the film itself is a translation, too.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03586.png\'><br>8:56 Emily Markert: Seen in this way, translation is not just about interpreting, but also creating meaningful exchange.<br>10:29 Shaelyn Hanes: Notice how Kiều just smelled the letter from her mother. Trinh references scent throughout the film, often as a way of summoning memory and evoking the sensation of love.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03587.png\'><br>10:35 Shaelyn Hanes: She writes: “...it seems that the time when, despite oneself, one becomes oversensitive and one\'s senses are wildly awoken, is when one is in the state of being in love. Since the film enacts this state, with all of its lucidity and its silliness, it is important to dedicate a large part of the film to the importance of smell”<br>12:39 Emily Markert: At certain moments throughout this scene, the music is as loud as or louder than the speakers in front of us.<br>12:53 Emily Markert: Trinh always tries to work against what she sees as the film industry’s “hierarchy between eye and ear,” wherein most film soundtracks are meant to simply underscore the images. In her words:<br>13:02 Emily Markert: “In my practice, you have the same \'rawness\' in the visual footage as in the sound recorded when you come to the editing table. Both are given the same importance as sometimes it is the image that determines the cut and other times it is the sound that dictates the unfolding of images.”<br>14:40 Emily Markert: Just 10 minutes into the film, we have learned Kiều plays many roles in her life: daughter, writer, painter, friend.<br>14:45 Emily Markert: The figure of Kiều plays many roles for Vietnamese women, too, as the story is widely read and revered. We heard this from Trinh in the narration of Surname Viet, too.<br>16:43 Shaelyn Hanes: Voyeurism is a key theme throughout this film. Through Trinh’s narrative, we witness the enactment of the male gaze as personified in the photographer, Alikan.<br>16:49 Shaelyn Hanes: Trinh also draws our attention to our own complicity in watching without being watched as viewers.<br>17:09 Emily Markert: Is A Tale of Love a love story or simply a story? Trinh writes: “‘…the entire history of narrative cinema is a history of voyeurism, and no matter what form it takes…the art of narrative cinema is unequivocally the art of resurrecting and soliciting love. A friend of mine once said that ‘all the books written and stored in the libraries are in fact one single book.’…You can never capture love or death on film, they are what I call, in A Tale, the two impossibles.”<br>17:58 Shaelyn Hanes: In A Tale of Love, Trinh has noted that she used “a space of acting whose slightly denaturalized performance would hit on very different sensitive chords in our reception of narrative film. It was more a question...of performing with the unknown (what is veiled to our ear and eye) within the appearance of the known.”<br>18:19 Shaelyn Hanes: The self-consciousness of the actors and script in A Tale of Love point to our role as spectators while exploring the types of freedoms that may be found in constrained spaces.<br>18:55 Emily Markert: “You have a beautiful voice” is a phrase we will hear repeated throughout the film.<br>19:02 Emily Markert: Knowing Trinh’s affinity for sound and music, consider the significance of this character who is drawn to Kiều because of her voice rather than her appearance.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03588.png\'><br>19:33 Shaelyn Hanes: I find this moment when Kiều randomly sings one note to be so strange and funny. Trinh describes her films as holding a dimension of humor that is apparent to some audiences and lost on others.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03589.png\'><br>19:36 Shaelyn Hanes: She writes of humor as “subtle, barely present, yet disturbing, tragic, anarchic, dissociative, moving and deconstructive.”<br>19:59 Shaelyn Hanes: San Francisco viewers may recognize the backdrop of this scene as the North Beach neighborhood. Here we see Kiều walk past landmarks such as The Stinking Rose and Caffé Roma.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03590.png\'><br>20:29 Emily Markert: We have mentioned the significance of walking in every Film Club. Here, as Kiều walks alone down the street at night, she embodies female mobility and freedom.<br>20:33 Emily Markert: From Trinh’s films to Jane Austen novels to protest marches, women walking can serve as a potent symbol of both vulnerability and power.<br>20:42 Emily Markert: But even in this moment of freedom, she is overwhelmed by the audio of a conversation about her familial and financial responsibilities. Can women really achieve freedom?<br>20:50 Emily Markert: This is a question posed by Surname Viet, too, specifically about Vietnamese women.<br>21:43 Shaelyn Hanes: In The Tale of Kiều, Kiều is repeatedly manipulated into working as a sex worker in different brothels. By likening her model work to sex work, Trinh’s Kiều identifies with the mythic character.<br>22:09 Emily Markert: Professional model is yet another role Kiều plays. Scholar Lan P. Duong says, “inhabiting all of these roles, [Kiều] represents a metonymic figure for diasporic women and their storytelling agency.”<br>23:09 Shaelyn Hanes: Of The Tale of Kiều, Trinh writes:<br>23:21 Shaelyn Hanes: “For me, it’s exceptional that the national poem of Vietnam is a love poem rather than an epic poem, and that the figure her people persistently choose to represent their collective self is that of a woman. What people see in the character of Kiều is a model of loyalty, sacrifice and victimization; one they fully apply to their personal situation and to that of their country, which has been geographically and historically a much coveted prey to foreign dominators.”<br>24:16 Shaelyn Hanes: These intimate scenes are matted in a way that points to the voyeurism that we participate in as viewers of a love story. Is this Kiều and Alikan?<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03591.png\'><br>24:28 Shaelyn Hanes: Regardless of who we are watching, this scene demonstrates what Trinh calls “the politics of the veil” by removing the characters’ and actors’ vision, leaving the audience to encounter their own.<br>24:36 Shaelyn Hanes: She writes: “The veil is oppressive, but it can also become a form of resistance.... The way we all partake in the politics and aesthetics of veiling is complex and often paradoxical.”<br>24:44 Shaelyn Hanes: Alikan’s statement about the color of the woman’s breasts is intended to be a clue to the blindfolded woman’s identity.<br>25:59 Emily Markert: The relationship between women and nationalism in Vietnam is the primary subject of Surname Viet. This description of the story of Kiều offered by the Tale Of narrator ties these two films together.<br>26:10 Emily Markert: It also speaks to the importance of oral history in Vietnamese culture and how women are often responsible for transmitting that history.<br>26:26 Emily Markert: To quote Lan P. Duong again, “With its emphasis on women’s oral discourses, the film underlines how women in the diaspora translate the archetypal figure of Kiều in their own ways, authoring and performing scripts of Kiều that counter the masculinist, nationalist narratives about her.<br>…These acts of translation and oral transmission by women lay the foundation for Trinh’s formulation of a feminism that renarrates the story of Vietnamese nationalism as told through Kiều.”<br>27:29 Shaelyn Hanes: It\'s important to note that in this scene, the voyeur is a woman.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03592.png\'><br>28:49 Shaelyn Hanes: This long, continuous shot scene that pans up, down and across physical space seems to again highlight our position as voyeurs.<br>28:54 Shaelyn Hanes: Trinh notes: “There is not a single shot-reverse-shot in the entirety of this feature- length film, and what may become perceptible when the camera stays fixed on two actors in dialogue, or when it passes by them in a mercilessly slow movement, is the very space of viewing and of performing.”<br>32:04 Emily Markert: Notice that Juliet, the editor of a women’s magazine, is the character through which Trinh explores ideas of fragrance, femininity, and memory.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03593.png\'><br>32:24 Emily Markert: Trinh cites perfume samples found in women’s magazines as a starting point for this association.<br>33:13 Emily Markert: The use of sound amidst dialogues like here draw our attention to the rhythm of the women’s speaking voices, amplifying our awareness of the power of their voices and the importance of oral history.<br>34:46 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Notice that Kiều just fell asleep in Juliet’s courtyard. Are we watching her dreams in these following scenes?<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03599.png\'><br>34:54 Shaelyn Hanes: ​As you may remember, dreams played an important role in our first two films, Night Passage and The Fourth Dimension<br>36:32 Shaelyn Hanes: ​This is a pivotal moment in Kiều’s transgression against the norms expected of her as a woman as she takes on the role of voyeur to watch Alikan, the photographer who typically watches women.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03595.png\'><br>37:13 Emily Markert: ​Trinh points to this scene as an example of a scene that uses “uncommon lines” that left both actors at a loss as to how to match “the right tone and reaction for them.”<br>37:18 Emily Markert: ​By encouraging unnatural moments such as this, Trinh highlights the fact that we are watching a performance.<br>38:36 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Notice how we just heard Kiều’s name being called by someone offscreen, and how this is used to signal our movement to a different realm of fantasy or memory.<br>38:44 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Trinh writes, “To hear one\'s name called by an ex-lover or by a relative can trigger unexpected memories or it can lead one to an immediate change of zone.\"<br>38:55 Emily Markert: ​This scene is an allusion to a famous opening moment in The Tale of Kiều. In the poem, Kiều finds an abandoned tomb at a temple and is later visited by the woman buried there.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03596.png\'><br>39:26 Emily Markert: ​Through this interaction, Kiều becomes aware of her own talent.<br>39:32 Emily Markert: ​She realizes “that women with many talents are bound in life to suffer” by recalling signs from her childhood that foreshadowed her own suffering.<br>39:41 Shaelyn Hanes: ​The element of water we see here is woven throughout the film, visually returning us to this scene in which Kiều is home in Vietnam, naked and playing freely.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03597.png\'><br>39:49 Shaelyn Hanes: ​This memory and the water running through it serve as “an intervention of women’s space.”<br>39:54 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Consider this concept of memory as women’s space in relation to the slow, heterogeneous rhythm that is Women’s Time in The Fourth Dimension.<br>40:00 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Water also comes with danger, as it is the cause of death for one of the female protagonists in Night Passage.<br>42:18 Shaelyn Hanes: ​This is the third sequential scene in which Kiều gets wet in the rain, a clue that A Tale of Love is not a linear storyline, but one that deals with a multiplicity of narratives and characters.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03598.png\'><br>42:24 Shaelyn Hanes: ​As you watch, notice how the narrative becomes less and less linear as the film progresses.<br>42:32 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Trinh scripted and filmed A Tale of Love as a series of storyboards with no set order to the scenes, allowing the film to take shape during shooting and find its final form during the editing phase.<br>42:38 Shaelyn Hanes: ​This process may account for some of the discomfort evident in the acting, which was intentionally heightened by Trinh.<br>42:53 Emily Markert: ​Trinh explores linearity in all of the films we have screened. Here, linearity or lack thereof helps convey the timelessness of the Kiều story.<br>42:56 Emily Markert: ​As Trinh has said, Kiều embodies not a character in a story but “a mirror that reflects other mirrors.”<br>44:13 Shaelyn Hanes: ​Trinh writes of the photographer, Alikan: “If we find Alikan offensive, then we should find ourselves all the more offensive.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03600.png\'><br>44:18 Shaelyn Hanes: For what he does is no more, no less to be criticized than what we do all the time in making or consuming images of love stories.<br>44:25 Shaelyn Hanes: We follow actors on screen to their most private places... And we demand that the gestures of love be exposed down to their most intimate details and to the widest number for the more “natural” they are, the more we revel in watching them and the better consumers we prove to be.”<br>45:55 Emily Markert: Nguyễn Du, the author of The Tale of Kiều, was himself controversial. The poem offered subtle political critique and referenced Chinese literature, just as Alikan does here.<br>46:14 Emily Markert: Duong has written “viewing Nguyễn as a quintessentially male artist, consigned to produce for a new culturally dominant and political regime, shows how men can also appropriate Kiều and her story as their own.” Do you think Alikan stands in for a representation of Nguyễn himself?<br>46:46 Shaelyn Hanes: While it might be suggested that we are watching Kiều and Alikan in these scenes, Trinh notes that she intended the blindfolded woman to be the model we saw with Alikan on the motorcycle earlier.<br>46:53 Shaelyn Hanes: Of this scene, she writes: “Vision and visuality have long been the domain in which male mastery is exerted, while the eroticism of the female body through touch is an area some feminists have reappropriated and theorized at length. On the other hand, one can say the film is a trap for the gaze, and the gender line is not so clear-cut.”<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03601.png\'><br>48:17 Emily Markert: This reference to Romeo and Juliet will come up again.<br>49:46 Emily Markert: This shot is an example of Trinh’s manipulation of the 35mm camera to counter the depth of field it afforded, deliberately flattening the image.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03602.png\'><br>49:50 Emily Markert: Without shadows and surfaces, we are forced to focus on the relationships between the things in the picture.<br>50:11 Shaelyn Hanes: Trinh talks about a Tale of Love as a film with multiple veils. The elements of the film might consist of some of these veils, as they function both independently and in concert with one another.<br>50:19 Shaelyn Hanes: For example, Trinh writes of the colors of the film: “Yellow, blue, red. These are the primary colors featured in the film, with green as a punctuation…But if you follow these colors in their full mobility, in their multifold relationship-in their contrast, texture, and rhythm-you may get involved in a story-track that can radically shift your reading of the film.”<br>51:12 Emily Markert: On a more meta scale, Trinh thinks of all films in general, especially documentaries, as incomplete assemblages.<br>53:23 Shaelyn Hanes: Here we experience a different type of voyeurism, observing a couple’s quarrel. The darkness of night serves as a veil in this scene and we are left wondering who we are watching and why.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03603.png\'><br>53:59 Shaelyn Hanes: Like the sounds that play amidst dialogues, this scene shows how Trinh tries to “[break] loose from the dualistic relation between translator and originator” using sound.<br>55:37 Emily Markert: Tradition and modernity were key themes in Trinh’s The Fourth Dimension, which we watched two weeks ago.<br>55:40 Emily Markert: Here we see Trinh addressing these concepts in relation to a Vietnamese family living in the United States.<br>55:49 Emily Markert: According to translator and scholar Huỳnh Sanh Thông, Kiều and her familial responsibilities symbolize the existential state of a diasporic community longing to hold onto a connection with Vietnam.<br>55:54 Emily Markert: The Fourth Dimension ostensibly posits that Japan itself is (or was, in 2001) in a similar position, looking to the past yet moving into the future.<br>58:19 Emily Markert: Lighting in Trinh\'s films is often meant to highlight (no pun intended) the relationships between the figures on screen, rather than add dramatic effect.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03604.png\'><br>59:39 Emily Markert: The low lighting here doesn\'t privilege one character over the other and emphasizes the content of their dialogue. The subtitles are also especially legible in this scene to that end.<br> 1:00:42 Emily Markert: This scene was described to us by Kiều in an earlier scene as one from The Tale of Kiều.<br>1:00:53 Emily Markert: This blending of narratives leads me to wonder which Kiều we are watching and when. Does this scene depict the modern Kiều or the mythical Kiều? Is it a fantasy or reality? Does it matter?<br>1:02:34 Shaelyn Hanes: Just as we saw the younger Kiều acknowledge the viewer earlier in the film, the adult Kiều now looks back at us as we watch her.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03605.png\'><br>1:02:38 Shaelyn Hanes: By returning our gaze, Kiều challenges our presumed objectivity as viewers, or what Donna Haraway might call the “conquering gaze from nowhere.”<br>1:02:42 Shaelyn Hanes: Trinh notes, “Looking back is also commonly experienced as an act of defiance, a perilous act that is historically feared for its ability to divest the Master of his power to possess and control…She who looks back rather than hide or be oblivious to her body and her sensuality is bound to provoke.”<br>1:03:20 Emily Markert: Moments like this one speak to Trinh’s awareness of her position as the filmmaker. Though not a documentary, A Tale and its emphasis on voyeurism is at many times self-reflexive on Trinh’s part.<br> 1:03:45 Emily Markert: Reflecting on the morality of Kiều while panning across these North Beach strip-clubs encourages us to reconsider the presumed “morality” of the women who work in these spaces.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03606.png\'><br> 1:04:28 Emily Markert: As film theorist Gwendolyn Foster said in an interview with Trinh, “Kiều forces us to think about the daily acts of resistance that so many women, particularly women who are read as \"victims,\" perform...By walking along beside the sex workers she gestures toward a rereading of sex worker as \"non-victim,\" and she claims space in a transgressive performative”<br>1:05:30 Shaelyn Hanes: Here, Kiều appears to be flipping through an art history book. She lands on an image of Gustave Courbet’s L’Origine du monde (1886), a famous art historical example of a “female body without a head.”<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03607.png\'><br><br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03608.png\'><br> 1:05:36 Shaelyn Hanes: The perspective of the image is also noticeably similar to the angle Alikan took when photographing the female model on the motorcycle earlier in the film.<br> 1:08:17 Emily Markert: Trinh writes of the dialogue in A Tale of Love: “These dialogues are...not real dialogues; they are written as story-spaces that are peculiar to each role designed…and despite their close interactions, they maintain their independent logic-not good versus bad logic, but only different ones.” <br>1:08:55 Emily Markert: In this way, Trinh uses the traditional structure of a film\'s narrative as a space for experimentation.<br>1:10:19 Emily Markert: If Alikan stands in for Nguyễn Du, in this scene the power of the male author and storyteller is subverted.<br>1:11:05 Emily Markert: Kiều’s empowerment and outspokenness assert a reclamation of the “timeless” patriarchal constructs at work in Nguyễn’s original story, especially as she becomes the purveyor of an historic story.<br>1:12:37 Shaelyn Hanes: Here, Java calls himself “not an aggressive eye\" person. The emphasis on touch and listening in this dialogue points to Trinh’s interest in dissecting and problematizing the assumed hierarchy of our senses, a theme that is interwoven throughout Night Passage and The Fourth Dimension, as well.<br> 1:12:54 Shaelyn Hanes: His comments about “ear contact” also speak to Trinh’s aforementioned interest in privileging sound as equal to or superior to sight in filmmaking.<br> 1:14:24 Emily Markert: By responding to letters addressed to Juliet of Verona, the character of Juliet again suggests a tie to the Romeo and Juliet and the multiplicity of Juliet\'s character in particular.<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03609.png\'><br>1:14:37 Emily Markert: At present, the Juliet Club (a real entity) receives an estimated 5,000 letters per year, three-quarters of which are from women.<br>1:14:46 Emily Markert: Romeo and Juliet is another “timeless” and highly gendered story about the constrictions of societal roles and challenges of fulfilling familial expectations.<br> 1:14:54 Emily Markert: Like The Tale of Kiều, Romeo and Juliet has been continually restaged and reinterpreted since it was written. <br>1:16:24 Emily Markert: As Juliet reads this letter from France, in English, consider again how translation factors into the film. <br>1:16:37 Emily Markert: Here is an important quote from Trinh on the act of translation: “When two spirals move together in a space, there are moments when they meet and others when they do not.<br>1:16:41 Emily Markert: Trying to find a trajectory that allows the two movements to meet as much as possible without subsuming one to the other is also how I see the process of translation.”<br>1:18:02 Shaelyn Hanes: At the Melbourne Writers’ Festival Forum, Trinh highlighted the role of “happy accidents” in her filmmaking as crucial to the creative process. She later pointed to this scene as an example.<br>1:18:11 Shaelyn Hanes: She notes that “The encounter was meant to be an opportunity for Kiều to pour out her heart, her loneliness as an exile and a foreigner. But when we shot the scene, Bacio, the dog, was so excited with the sweets Kiều enticed him with…that he got totally out of control and jumped all over her.”<br><img src=\'https://wattis.org/media/03610.png\'><br>1:18:38 Shaelyn Hanes: Trinh read the dog’s movements as “graceful” and “perfect for a context of love,” despite the mood’s disjuncture with the script.<br> 1:23:40 Emily Markert: Notice how the camera tracks Kiều in the same way that Alikan does. Even without seeing his character lurking in the background, we know that we are following Kiều without her knowledge.<br>1:23:49 Emily Markert: Think, too, of Trinh’s self-reflexivity as the filmmaker.<br> 1:24:21 Emily Markert: By the way, this is not the only film about The Tale of Kiều that takes place in San Francisco. In 2006, Vietnamese-American Vũ Thu Hà directed a short film on Kiều set here.<br>1:25:33 Emily Markert: Here again walking is an act that makes Kiều vulnerable but ultimately empowers and frees her as she escapes Alikan’s shadow.<br>1:31:51 Shaelyn Hanes: In this moment, Kiều seems to be seeing through the veiled layers of the film’s characters.<br>1:32:02 Shaelyn Hanes: Conflict is one of these veils. Trinh writes that, “what appeared as conflict never got resolved because there was no real conflict in the film.<br>1:32:05 Shaelyn Hanes: So the story I offer turns out to be in the end just a moment of a no-story.”<br>1:32:21 Shaelyn Hanes: By focusing less on the content of the narrative and more on each character’s signifying traits, Kiều begins to understand the “no-story” of the film that she exists within.<br>1:33:09 Shaelyn Hanes: The jarring and unexpected dissonance of this strange music creates a really visceral response for me.<br>1:33:18 Shaelyn Hanes: Writer Nasrullah Mambrol observes Trinh’s use of dissonant sound and music as “characteristic of postmodern feminist poetic transgressions.”<br>1:34:10 Emily Markert: The disconnect between sound and dialogue/action increases as we near the end of the film.<br>1:35:49 Emily Markert: The phrase “four-letter word” in English evokes profanity, but that is not what Kiều means by the phrase here.<br>1:35:54 Emily Markert: The misnomer represents a breakdown of translation, and serves to poke a hole in the dominance of English.<br>1:36:32 Emily Markert: Translation is also increasingly tenuous towards the end of the film.<br>1:36:49 Shaelyn Hanes: Trinh speaks of the darkness of night acting as a veil that gestures to the rules in many societies that dictate when a woman may be out on the street.<br>1:36:58 Shaelyn Hanes: She writes that the night belongs “to those of the margins: sex workers, drug users, secret lovers, and so on. So the scenes of women walking outdoors can be liberatory, but they also remind us of the values of society and the restraints it puts on women in their movement. For how is a woman walking aimlessly alone at night looked at?”<br>1:38:43 Emily Markert: Here Trinh reveals (or confirms) that the blinded man in the dream was Alikan. This seems to mark an important point in Kiều’s transformation from objectified model to she who sees.<br>1:38:57 Emily Markert: You may remember that Kiều fell asleep in this space much earlier on in the film, which encourages us to probe at the nature of the events that fall between these two scenes.<br>1:39:04 Emily Markert: Has Kiều been dreaming, fantasizing, remembering this entire time?<br>1:39:13 Emily Markert: Trinh writes, “No single linear explanation can account for these narrative interfaces in which performer and performance, dreamer and dream are constituted like the two sides of a coin...One cannot say that she\'s simply moving in and out of fantasy and reality, but rather, that it\'s a different zone we are experiencing.”<br> 1:39:55 Shaelyn Hanes: It’s notable that the relationship between Juliet and Kiều is the central relationship in A Tale of Love, rather than any of the relationships between Kiều and the various men she crosses paths with.<br>1:40:21 Shaelyn Hanes: By noting that “Only Juliet will live forever” through her letters and her “track of scents passed from lover to lover” Trinh foregrounds both the infinite multiplicity of these two characters and the importance of female love and friendship.<br>1:40:46 Emily Markert: Trinh has also said: “There are as many Kiềus as there are talented women across generations whose destinies Kiều\'s story has typified…<br>1:41:02 Emily Markert: Juliet is a name that stands for a person; at the same time, she\'s a character in the film whose fiction evolves from another fiction; she\'s a symbol for love and a love site that is radically a multiplicity.” <br>1:45:23 Shaelyn Hanes: As we’ve seen in Night Passage and The Fourth Dimension, Trinh often uses improvisation to create a space between the experimental and the documentary in her films.<br>1:45:31 Shaelyn Hanes: In this scene, she asked Juliet to combine different types of dances, improvising in order to create one that was uniquely her own.<br>1:45:44 Shaelyn Hanes: She writes: “it\'s a dance that comes out as a physical response to what she\'s hearing, that is, an intellectual reflection.<br>1:45:49 Shaelyn Hanes: It\'s a form of resisting the closure of meaning, whether in movements of the body or of the mind.”<br>1:46:30 Emily Markert: Throughout A Tale of Love, Kiều tries to balance her various roles and the binary oppositions of being an independent, sensual woman and a modest exemplar of filial piety.<br>1:46:36 Emily Markert: In each of the four films we have screened, we have seen Trinh create space for female characters to exist in between rigid binaries such as these.<br>1:46:41 Emily Markert: Her films also occupy a space between film binaries such as “fiction” and “nonfiction.”<br>1:46:55 Emily Markert: Through her use of creative cinematography, experimental sound and music, and a mixture of written scripts and improvised interpretations, her films defy categorization.<br>1:47:21 Shaelyn Hanes: We hope our commentary over the past few weeks has provided useful tools and information for watching and analyzing Trinh’s films that will encourage you to continue exploring her work.<br>1:47:34 CCA Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts: Thank you for virtually joining us tonight and throughout the month.<br>1:47:43 CCA Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts: This program has been part of the Wattis Institute’s year-long season dedicated to the questions posed by the work of Trinh T.

The reach of art’s ecosystems spreads and legitimates Vicuña’s oeuvre, but at what cost? <br><br>Though Vicuña’s artworks are mostly encountered within art institutions, it is important to see these places as rooted in the idea of art as permanence - Vicuña’s works hold this tension, even as they seek a beyond and through, a location and workspace akin to the place of black study, the undercommons present in Fred Moten’s work. <br><br>Yeats’ poem can be read to argue that art is integrally linked to permanence, though possibly to subversive end. In this light, it represents a concrete, Western structure of knowledge that Vicuña’s practice works against, transcending stark boundaries altogether. <br><br>In Bryan-Wilson’s art historical book, she contextualizes Vicuña’s work in its political resonances, but further attempts to triangulate the artist’s practice for a wider, normative narrative of art historical practice that stretches beyond Vicuña’s stated contexts. <br><br>In Vicuña’s poetry, some works sway, ebb, and flow, imbued with a sense of aliveness, a vitality that is inherently an inbetween-ness, a refusal to be singular in its definition.  <br><br>In an allied set of actions, the precarios that Cecilia Vicuña brings into the world find their completion at the point they wash away. <br><br>The following questions are like an opening, a stone thrown into a lake, a means of being that enumerates the same elliptical, nearly circular journey that this sentence strives to replicate, even as it falls short of capturing its essence. They are inspired by the reading group’s conversation, even as they encourage you to undertake your own study. The words circle around the art.<br><br><i>Begin these questions where you like.</i> <br><br>What is permanence, and what is transience?<br><br>What separates the permanent from permanence, the transient from transience? <br><br>Which is easier to define - permanent or transient? <br><br>Can either be defined fully? In the case that a definition seems to fall short, once again, is this not a condition of the permanent nature of transience?<br><br>What does it mean to try to triangulate the terms permanence or transience in a meaningful way?<br><br>Do the questions signify an entrypoint? Do they signify a stage in between, a constant becoming? What do these questions do?<br><br>What relationship does permanence and/ or transience have to Vicuña’s precarios?

This summary opens onto these entries as an opening for your own inquiry. We encourage you to start where it makes most sense, and to understand where you end as not a final cessation, but an invitation to continue weaving, in your own way.<br><br>This question was brought into dialogue with the following readings:<br>	Chapter 2 of <i>Fray: Art and Textile Politics</i> by Julia Bryan-Wilson<br>	<i>Frame, Flow and Reflection: Ritual and Drama as Public Liminality</i> by Victor Turner<br>	“Cecilia Vicuña, Museum of Contemporary Art North Miami” by Monica Uszerowicz<br><br>Bryan-Wilson’s chapter of <i>Fray</i> details the complex underpinnings of Vicuña’s early work in exile, relating to her experiences of the Chilean coup against Salvador Allende, and her turn toward Indigenous pre-colonial practices. It also expands upon her use of woven materials as a feminized, intimate method of production, a valuation of small, individual gestures and their gravitational orbit of relations. <br><br>In Turner’s anthropological text, he speaks to the ways in which ritual provides a fragile transfer between states, a narrow place of intrinsic delicacy that is sometimes known as the liminal. In realizing this transfer within wider societal frames, he invokes the idea of a public ritual, in which collective performance allows for the symbolic transfer from a stable state to a fleeting in-between, an action that exists in the realm of the subjunctive or “non actual” before its transition to another stable state. Such a description is worth digging deeper into in light of Vicuña’s performance practice. <br><br>As such, Userowicz’s review provides a short but stunning account of Vicuña’s performance-based activation of her formal work at the MCA North Miami, in which she emitted a humming, droning set of utterances from deep within herself, in the process wrapping 50 participants in a woolen quipu. The review also provides language describing Vicuña’s work as archaeological, and further resurrectional.<br><br>        In thinking alongside the different facets of Vicuña’s practice brought to bear in <a href = \'/browse-the-library/911/reading-lists-conversations-and-other-texts/whose-footsteps-are-these-a-preface-to-cecilia-vicua-a-by-jenni-crain\' target= \'new\'>previous reading group iterations</a>, what brings together the precarios, quipus, poems, performances within Vicuña’s performance?<br><br>        What relationship does ritual possess to the varying facets of Vicuña’s practice?<br><br>        Are her works ritual objects? Do they operate in separate ways simultaneously?<br><br>The concept of the “red thread” was brought into play as a proposed means of synthesizing the complex set of tendencies present across Vicuña’s practice. It was analogized via the red spider thread of Ariadne used by Theseus to escape the minotaur’s labyrinth in Greek mythology, as well as the red thread, used to symbolize the concept of fate in Chinese cosmology. It was noted that red can also symbolize blood, and more specifically menstruation, an important reference in Cecilia’s feminist approach to art making.   <br>	<br>	What comes to mind when you think of red thread? <br><br>        What type of presence does a thread leave in the world? What type of tension? Who makes threads? Why?<br>	<br>        What does it mean to bring other cultural contexts into dialogue with the Indigenous world she mines? What does it mean to cross pollinate these allegories across space-time?<br><br>This was discussed in relation to blood as a somatic system that sustains the body while simultaneously existing pre-knowledge and therefore able to elude epistemological boundaries. <br><br>	What is bloody in Vicuña’s work? What is embodied? Does that matter? <br><br>        Is red a useful color to isolate this ritualistic tendency? Is thread a useful analogy? What is a thread that can’t be haptically perceived? When is thread temporary?<br><br>        What does it mean to speak to Vicuña’s objects and practices with other objects and practices?<br> <br>        When thinking with practices such as Vicuña’s that hold the interpersonal so intimately, is there an appropriate distance to engage in ethical inquiry?<br><br>        What does Vicuña want us to know? What does she want us to feel? What does she want us to be? Are any of these things knowable, or even things as such?<br><br>In a 2018 performance during her exhibition at the Bay Area Museum/ Pacific Film Archive, Vicuña engaged in a babbling, non-verbal sound making, an incantation between a prayer and a cry that implicated the audience in a close, swaying environment. In doing so, it was posited that she could be embodying the shaman, or crone, a femme figure key to activating ritual in Turner\'s thinking. A recorded excerpt of this work was played for the reading group - it was disclosed that there was some institutional discomfort due to the unpredictability of her performance. <br><br>        What does sound without words mean to you? When was the last time you were physically close, swayed with another person? Will we ever recover the way that felt before the pandemic?<br>        What does such an experience in a gallery setting mean? <br><br>        How, why, and where do you make artwork? What does working in detritus in the natural world conjure to you? What can it be? <br>	<br>        How does something become noticed as an emergent state of being? Is being noticed a mandate put onto the object? Or onto the observer? <br><br>        What does this mean for encounters within a museum, or an institution? Is the museum too cordoned off from daily life? Is the gallery becoming too familiar?<br><br>        What is missing from Vicuña’s work within the white cube of a gallery?<br><br>        What is lost when Vicuña’s method is taken too closely as an institutional instead of a collective mandate? <br><br>        Is the liminal truly possible in a gallery space? Was it ever possible? <br><br>        Does this distinction between “inside” the space of art versus “outside” matter? <br><br>This fragile, temporary, partial condition of Vicuña’s oeuvre is held as something other than weakness, asking an earlier question in a different way:<br><br>	What type of question does a thread create? <br>',''),(1172,1,'2021-01-29 19:45:06','2021-01-29 19:45:32',NULL,'Free',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'free',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',_binary 'Everything we do is always free and open to all.',''),(1173,1,'2021-01-30 00:47:35','2021-02-02 01:43:24',NULL,'Vicuna/Borzutzky Screening',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'vicuna-borzutzky-screening',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '...A premiere screening of new films by Cecilia Vicuña, and a conversation between the artist and Daniel Borzutzky\r\n\r\n<a href=\"/calendar/thursday-february-11-2021\">Thursday, February 11</a>\r\nOnline, 5 pm PST\r\n\r\nRSVP <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/screening-conversation-cecilia-vicuna-and-daniel-borzutzky-tickets-133902928263\" target=\'new\'>here</a> for event link.\r\n\r\nThe conversation will be in English with Spanish subtitles.',_binary 'For almost fifty years, the policies that have ruled Chile since the 1973 military coup have remained more or less stable.

Du Bois offered a fundamental challenge to the entanglements of United States racism, capitalism, and imperialism throughout the twentieth century. They offered positions on the “Negro Question,” superexploitation, self-determination, and the economic basis of racial antagonism that not only challenged U.S. racial capitalism, but also envisioned a world predicated upon peace, socialism, mutual cooperation, and human flourishing. <br><br>The talk also explicates the form of repression and state-sanctioned violence to which these freedom fighters were subjected because of their political orientation.

He recalled the exhilarating sensation he felt as a teenager driving his first car. This inaugural sense of agency heightened his awareness, and his body felt alive in ways that left an impression on him today.<br><br>Another participant thought about the life-force in relation to the museum collection. She noted that the institutional act of collecting objects is “directly oppositional” to this sense of awareness. We discussed the various barriers that may limit the body from having a relational and sensory experience with the art object.<br><br><i>How is “properness” associated with “ownership”?</i> <br><br>We discussed museum collections, and the absence of touch in relation to an art object. We critiqued the assumption of ownership inherent to these collections, and how these assumptions are interlinked with colonial notions of  “respectability.” <br><br>We reflected on how Vicuna’s work often subverts these notions of properness through interactive and tactical performances. <br><br>A quote on otherness introduced the idea of a perceptual shift into “knowing <i>that</i> something is” rather than “knowing <i>what</i> something is.” This led to discussions on opacity, and a right to opacity by the most unknown elements of our surroundings. Perhaps the life-force is not meant to be understood, known, or named.

As ancestral wisdom flows downstream, with bits inevitably getting lost along the way, one must work to safeguard and pass on as much of it as possible—growth doesn’t come from acquiring something but from remembering and sharing it. <i>Giving</i> matters far more than <i>taking</i>.<br><br>When writing a score, a musician is making music but is also <i>giving</i> music. As a set of prompts, guidelines, or instructions, a score comes alive when it is read and interpreted, and, as such, it’s a language that begets others languages—it doesn’t tell people what to think as much as it asks to be transformed into something else. It’s a way to provide direction in the form of a question.<br><br>When conceived as a score, an artistic gesture doesn’t extract, it only pollinates. Like a renewable form of energy, it gives back more than it takes. <br><br>[image1]<br><br>Raven Chacon listens to music, makes music, teaches music, writes music, remembers music, and gives music. He grew up hearing his grandfather sing traditional Navajo songs, and learned about his heritage via the metaphor of song, where history stays oral and fluid, safe from the many traps set by the written word. The radio stations he heard on the reservation played a lot of heavy metal and rock music, and he soon found himself starting thrash metal bands and launching a record label, SickSickSick Distro (“Loud Music from the Southwest U.S”), in Albuquerque, New Mexico. <br><br>Chacon’s work flows in four directions: he teaches chamber music to high school students on Native American reservations as part of the Native American Composer Apprentice Project (NACAP); he performs his own improvised music, often using instruments he builds himself; he writes music for others in the form of scores, sometimes using standard notation and other times using more abstract and invented graphic marks; and he creates sound installations and moving image works, as a member of Postcommodity for ten years, and now on his own.<br><br>[image2]<br><br>An example: for his oratorio <i>Tremble Staves</i> (2017-2019), performed amongst the ruins of San Francisco’s Sutro Baths, Chacon and his collaborators use guitars, a bathroom sink, a floating cello, a narrator, dowsing rods, bird calls, amplified tiles, stirred broken mirrors, amplified fishing rods, a homemade feedback ukulele, an oxygen tank, student guitarists, and thirteen percussionists. The score allows the performance to take place within ruins that are near any large body of water. <br><br>Another: <i>Report</i> (2001/2015) is to be played by eight types of rifles. Or his <i>American Ledger</i> scores (2018 and 2019) are to be presented on a flag, a wall, a blanket, a billboard, or a door. <br><br>[image3]<br><br>As a Diné (Navajo) artist, Chacon often feels the burden for his work to “explain” or at least “show the influence of” his Native American identity. All those well-intentioned white people, myself included, want to feel like we are “listening to,” “making space for,” and “empowering” others, after all, and certain boxes need to be checked in order for that to count. Instead, Chacon uses his own indigeneity only as a lens—it is not the subject of his work but it reflects, colors, and filters how he sees the world. <br><br>(With Chacon’s <i>…lahgo adil’i dine doo yeehosinilgii yidaaghi</i> [2004], a chamber orchestra is faced with a graphic score that has a Navajo title and abstract Indigenous symbols, but no additional or specific instructions. Should the [most probably non-Native] musicians choose to make it sound “Native American,” it will only be because they impose it on themselves.)<br><br>Whether it’s the Christian Bible or the Navajo’s <i>Diné Bahaneʼ</i>, any creation story is like a score—it’s a story that spans generations, told by countless different people in different ways, while maintaining a somewhat consistent narrative arc. Their paradox is that while they seem to outline a point of origin, the endless adjustments made to any creation myth, as they are told and interpreted over time, obstruct the very possibility of there being an “origin.” The process of forced migration changes the nature of the departure point, making it impossible to ever “go home.”<br><br>What does “home” actually refer to, now, for members of the Navajo nation? If it’s been colonized, can it ever go back to being pre-colonized? Can it be un-colonized or de-colonized? Or is it only ever post-colonized, with histories of knowledge, trauma, violence, oppression, and resilience weaving into one another, one no more “original” than the other?<br><br>[image4]<br><br>Music, like history, is a collective activity. People make music with others and play music to others. A score, by definition, is <i>for</i> others, and musicians will interpret it differently when they play one together. <br><br>Each one of Chacon’s newest series of graphic scores, <i>For Zitkala</i> (2020-2021), is written for a specific Native American female composer—Ange Loft, Autumn Chacon, Barbara Croall, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Candice Hopkins, Carmina Escobar, Cheryl L’Hirondelle, Heidi Senungetuk, Jacqueline Wilson, Laura Ortman, Suzanne Kite, Joy Harjo, and Olivia Shortt—and form musical “portraits.” They aren’t composed at a distance, like a tribute, but are made of what Chacon learned from his time spent carefully listening to and learning from each woman. <br><br>[image5]<br><br>2020 and 2021, however, have been years when most of our activities haven’t been collective, or when forms of collectivity have been radically redefined. <br><br>For his residency at the Wattis Institute, unable to perform and collaborate in person, Chacon launches a radio station, <i>Radio Coyote</i>. He brings together five long-time collaborators, all of whom are fellow musicians and fellow educators, and, together, they create dozens of hours of original content, over the course of three months, for an online and FM radio broadcast—online because it bridges the social distances that now separate everyone, and FM because all forms of expression must necessarily be embodied and anchored by their physical site.  <br><br>More than anything, <i>Radio Coyote</i> is a way for these collaborators to continue talking with and listening to each other, even at a distance.<br><br>Ginger Dunnill interviews Indigenous, activist, Queer, women-identifying, BIPOC, and lost/stolen heritage artists; A. Smiley’s program is rooted in the Bay Area’s community of artists of color; Michael Begay dives deep into the world of Indigenous metal; Zachary James Watkins explores forty years of his own musical compositions and influences; Raven Chacon himself broadcasts live from various locations across the Bay Area and plays every single release from his record label from start to finish; and Mark Trecka mixes popular and avant-garde music, archival recordings, field recordings, interviews, and original music, as well as fragments from the other <i>Radio Coyote</i> shows, as they happen, tying more knots into the knots. <br><br>Chacon interrupts the stream now and then to present <i>Free Form</i>, a spontaneous program reflecting his stay in the Bay Area and featuring programming from local artists and musicians.<br><br>[image6]<br><br><i>When conceived as a score, an artistic gesture doesn’t extract, it only pollinates. Like a renewable form of energy, it gives back more than it takes.</i> During his three months in San Francisco, Chacon won’t be extracting knowledge from the land but will be learning how to hear its voices, listening for what it chooses to share and what it prefers to withhold. His goal is not agreement, disagreement, or even comprehension, but establishing forms of solidarity where different perspectives gather, co-exist, make something with each other, and mutually adapt to a context as it evolves, like an ensemble. <br>',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(1189,1,'2021-03-13 22:55:39','2021-03-16 09:04:34',3731,'A premiere screening of new films by Cecilia VicuÃ±a, and a conversation between the artist and Daniel Borzutzky',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'a-premiere-screening-of-new-films-by-cecilia-vicua-a-and-a-conversation-between-the-artist-and-daniel-borzutzky',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',_binary 'On February 11, 2021, Cecilia Vicuña premiered four new short videos followed by a talk with poet and translator Daniel Borzutzky.

Two pieces caught my attention due to their use of noise as a source of meaning and a tool for political transformation. By combining different instruments, songs, and voice inflections, each short film offers a sensuous experience to the viewer that connects directly to how the body has reframed collective action in Chile and the world over the last decades. The short film “Rito por el Mapocho” (2021) depicts a collective ritual enacted in 2019 alongside the river that crosses Santiago from East to West. In the film, a group of people sing to and interact with the drying riverbed to speak against the privatization of water that began in Chile in 1981. “El veroír empezó” (2021) records a 2019 singing performance held at the Gabriela Mistral Cultural Center (GAM) that invited visitors/participants to closely look at each other, thereby honoring the lives and sensitivities of those protesters that lost one or both eyes by hands of Chilean security agents in 2019.<br><br><img src=\'https://www.wattis.org/media/03674.jpg\'><br><br>These films were both made in Santiago de Chile in a period of substantial political unrest. Years of repressed social frustration exploded on October 18th, 2019, when millions of people took to the streets for over five months, demanding the end of an inhumane system articulated through dictatorship and perpetuated by a constitution still in rule space to recount here. However, what is most relevant to note is that stemming from decades of repression, people have found ways to speak back to hegemonic structures that are more and more connected to physicality and poetry: languages that Vicuña knows very well. In fact, over the past decade in Chile, the body has become the most crucial space for public meaning to be challenged and transformed. This transformation is especially prominent in Vicuña’s films, as she makes work responding to situations in which the body is directly affected: legalized water looting leaving whole towns without water to drink or cook, and the police shooting rubber bullets that left 400+ pacific protesters blind in one or both eyes. Within this context, and responding to levels of violence that regard certain human bodies as disposable, the collectivities that perform in Vicuña’s videos decide to transform themselves into living instruments, as if they could sing, murmur, moan, and yell their way out of pain and injustice. The tension each performance provokes in the viewer seems to rely on how the participants’ sounds continuously move from a state of musical harmony into one of cacophonic disruption. While intuition is a crucial component of Vicuña’s art, I believe these gestures are also historically situated.<br><br><img src=\'https://www.wattis.org/media/03675.jpg\'><br><br>In 1981, in the middle of the bloody and highly repressive dictatorship led by Augusto Pinochet, Chilean artist Alfredo Jaar made a video performance called “Opus (1981/Andante Desesperato),” in which he desperately played the flute for over seven minutes, originating all kinds of dissonant noises until he ran out of breath. The piece, simple and straightforward in configuration, depicted one way Jaar found to speak without words to regain a means of (paralinguistic) expression during a moment in which speaking meant putting one’s life at risk.<br><br><img src=\'https://www.wattis.org/media/03676.jpg\'><br><br>Thirty years after this, in 2011, a ninemonth-long wave of massive student-led protests demanded access and equity in the educational system that was vastly privatized and legally turned into a business during Pinochet’s dictatorship between 1981 and 1986. Amid a convoluted country and following a series of public performances that sought to reconfigure the traditional format of the protest, a group of art students referenced Jaar’s piece by frantically playing all sorts of instruments in front of La Moneda, the Chilean government’s palace (figure 4). The deafening noise lasted several minutes, confusing both passersby and the state security agents surrounding the area with anti-riot water cannon trucks. Finally, police officers took some of the protesters into custody, forcing the action to end.<br><br>With these two historical episodes in mind, the changing stridency of Vicuña’s performances seem to address the current political moment while addressing the past, channeling its suffering and honoring the legacy of those who have lived and died by resisting. Though made by a Chilean artist and stemming from recent Chilean history, these video pieces are not only about Chile. Beyond national frontiers, the complexity of the body as a historically and spatially situated force has gained political agency at a global scale as we see the struggle for survival becoming more critical and pervasive. How can language transform reality? Cecilia Vicuña’s films ask this question over and over again. In a world where words have become increasingly suspicious and insufficient, the body seems to be our only way out. In this regard, “Rito por el Mapocho” and “El veroír empezó” act as possible paths to reclaim the agency we all have as living, sensitive, resonant human beings. Now, let us hope for the day all these noises finally reach the ears of the ones who conveniently and persistently choose not to hear. <br><br>Consuelo Tupper Hernández (Chile, 1992) is an interdisciplinary artist and writer, currently a second year MFA Fine Arts student at CCA.<br><br>Images:<br>(1) Cecilia Vicuña, <i>Ritual by the Mapocho River</i> (2021), digital video, 11 min.<br>(2) Cecilia Vicuña, <i>Seehearing began</i> (2021), digital video, 10 min.<br>(3) Alfredo Jaar, <I>Opus (1981/Andante Desesperato)</i> (1981), video registered on a Betamax camera, 7 min. 15 sec. <br>(4) Protesters playing instruments in front of La Moneda.

On March 19, a formal “shelter-in-place” order was issued by the governor of California, and just like that, life as we knew it changed. It is easy to lose track of how many days we have been sheltering in place. We were told this would be over April 7, a date later revised to April 30, and it is almost certain that date will shift again.<br><br><i>The Word for World is Forest</i> was scheduled to open one week from today at the CCA Wattis Institute. The exhibition was to be the culmination and celebration of a year of research, collaboration, and imagination, and the capstone to our final year in the Curatorial Practice Graduate Program. As the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc on the world, it became clear that the show and its opening would not take place as planned. Amidst a flood of emails in our inboxes about cancelled and postponed events, exhibitions, and programs, it is hard to pinpoint whether we received this news before we learned that hundreds of cultural workers were laid off at museums around the world or after. While we are disappointed and heartbroken, mourning the loss of an exhibition in the wake of global crisis feels selfish, untimely, and foolish.<br><br>Along with many facets of life, <i>The Word for World is Forest</i> now exists in an unpredictable state. We are trying to learn how to move forward holding uncertainty. Even the Bay Area weather doesn’t seem to know what to do. Days of sunshine pull us out of our sweatpants to feel the tingle of something on the edges of our skin, followed by grey rainstorms pushing us back inside. We pivot back and forth, between sadness and joy—sadness at the state of affairs and joy found in a plant’s new sprouts, the first hummingbird arriving to a newly built feeder, or a loved one’s call. We try to move forward against an invisible force compelling us to slow down. Sometimes we cave to the tension between forces, and sometimes we push through. Neither is the right answer right now. <br><br>It is important to understand we are also humans after all, with our own existential crises, worried about our families and loved ones, about visas, about our own financial precarity and graduating soon, and about many others. No matter what happens, we keep talking with each other, listening, giving space, trying to understand. We feel grateful for those who support us, artists who stand next to us in this chaos, and the mentors and people who are there for us. <br><br><i>The Word for World is Forest</i> brings up the notion that societal changes can emerge from looking to the past and present. At this moment in time, we are facing multiple ruptures in the fabric that structures how we navigate our day to day lives. Our mission for this exhibition remains and has become all the more timely as the reality of a worldwide crisis sets in. How can we do this world-building from the confines of our isolation?<br><br>Looking to Ursula K. Le Guin, we remember the power of imagination ignited through books and stories. If the pandemic has taught us anything, it is that we need to reimagine the possibilities with what we have available to us and not lose hope because of bleak circumstances. Here, in these pages, lies an exhibition that may never come to physical fruition. At the moment, we cannot install the artworks, paint the wall, nor turn on the lights in the Wattis gallery, but that does not limit our ability to reify the project through our imaginations. Page by page, we will walk you through the selected artists and their works, leave space for some of them to tell their own stories, and invite you to plant your own seeds. <br><br>This catalog proposes many possibilities. We hope you can take some comfort in that.  Sit in your best chair, and prepare to be transported to the world this exhibition begins to build, in the hopes we will meet one day. Until we are released back into our own world, we will stay home to make sure that we are not a threat for the vulnerable ones, and hope for a better future for us all, as Ursula did. <br><br>—Fiona Ball, Naz Cuguoğlu, Chloe Kwiatkowski, Orly Vermes<br><br><p align=\"center\">***</p><br><a name=\"garden\"></a><span style=\"border-bottom: solid;\">A Garden Growing in Place</span><br><br>Beatriz Cortez and her collaborator Elizabeth Pérez Márquez guided the curatorial cohort through planting garden plants indigenous to the Americas.

It invites the audience to envision an existence of mutual respect, care, and survival. Artists Sofía Córdova, Beatriz Cortez, Candice Lin, Allison Smith, and Patrick Staff provide lenses for viewing time as malleable and circular—constructing a world where the future is, in fact, possible and within reach.<br> <br>This exhibition takes its name from Ursula K. Le Guin’s novella <i>The Word for World is Forest</i>. In the 1972 work, Le Guin imagines a future scenario where humans have created a colony on another planet to exploit the native population and strip the land of its resources, as they have done in reality many times over on this planet. The native community, called the Athsheans, live in peace and harmony with their surroundings. Athsheans see all beings as interconnected: In their language, the word for “world” and “forest” is the same. <br><br>As an experiment to align a curatorial vision with Le Guin, we strived to become human, become humus, or as ecofeminist and theorist Donna J. Haraway suggests, <i>become-with</i> her, rather than speak about her. Both Le Guin and the artists featured in <i>The Word for World is Forest</i> look to speculative fiction and its strategies to imagine new ways of being after trauma. A broader term encompassing genres such as science fiction, alternate history, fantasy, and utopian and dystopian fiction, speculative fiction carries the potential for imagination. The genre provides a platform to rewrite power structures—a space to envision anti-colonial or decolonial futures. Speculative fiction provides us with alternative futures and ways to move forward.  <br><br><i><span style=\"border-bottom: solid;\">The Vine May Take Over the Gallery</span></i><br><br>Many of the exhibition’s artworks utilize organic materials to create a new consciousness. Various plant lives are cherished for their intrinsic existence, and mutual care and respect are restored. The power relations between plant allies and human bodies are equalized.<br><br>Sofía Córdova’s new video, finished for this exhibition as part of her <i>dawn chorus</i> series (ongoing), takes place five hundred years in the future. Filmed in Finland, New Mexico, and Wisconsin, the work is a meditation on post-ecological collapse. Córdova imagines a future where the site of capitalistic worship has been destroyed and a deluge has left humanity in a state of ambivalence. The work opens with a poem by Puerto Rican poet and activist Julia de Burgos titled “Yo fui la mas callada” (“I Was the Quietest”). The poem tells a narrative marked by references to both the sea and desert. In the video, underlying imagery of barren sand dunes and lush green foliage are references to the Finnish Civil War and Hurricane Maria’s destruction in Puerto Rico. At times acting as protagonists, the forest and the desert become ever-present backdrops to Córdova’s historical retellings and futuristic speculations. <br><br>Candice Lin and Patrick Staff’s <i>Hormonal Fog</i> (2016–ongoing) sets the scene for a future where the body is truly malleable and vulnerable. <i>Hormonal Fog</i> is a smoke machine that makes use of homemade herbal tinctures to produce a smoke of hormones that lowers testosterone levels in the body. In a text written about this work, Lin and Staff ask, “What is ancient about herbalism and what is modern about gender transition? What is modern about herbalism, and what is ancient about transitioning?” (1) This symbiotic relationship between body and plants brings us back to the words of Haraway. Her book <i>Staying with the Trouble</i> echoes the importance of an equitable relationship between humankind and nature as a way of recognizing the inalienable rights of all beings. She writes, <br><br><i>Instructed by companion species of the myriad terran kingdoms in all their placetimes, we need to reseed our souls and our home worlds in order to flourish—again, or maybe just for the first time—on a vulnerable planet that is not yet murdered…Recuperation is still possible, but only in multispecies alliance, across the killing divisions of nature, culture, and technology and of organism, language, and machine.</i> (2)<br><br>The importance of a multispecies coalition in order to save the planet (and ourselves) cannot be denied. According to Haraway, a decolonized feminist future cannot exist with human beings at the top of a speciated hierarchy. We all must recognize that humanity has much to learn from our kindred species, and we are not the masters of the earth. The nonhuman kin that surrounds us has as much to contribute to the quality of life on this planet as we do, and have as much of a breathing, living consciousness—and right to exist—as we do.  <br><br>Haraway also cites Le Guin’s <i>The Word for World is Forest</i> as a narrative of the all-too-familiar struggle between colonization and a thriving multispecies planet. She states that one must look back to terraforming, to the cultivation of the earth and its sacred rights, to bring forth a future worth living. (3) We must look to the seeds for knowledge and leadership. We must let the plants show us their voice.<br><br>Created by the curatorial cohort through the instruction and guidance of Beatriz Cortez and her collaborator Elizabeth Pérez Márquez, a garden, initially intended for the gallery, has been grown in our homes. As Cortez notes—these plants are gifts from Indigenous ancestors across the Americas who preserved them for us. To create a generous exchange between the plants and humanity, we have included instructions for planting your own garden in the catalog. On the last day of the exhibition, the public would be invited to take an individual plant home with them, to care for and cultivate it for nourishment and for the generations who are yet to come.<br><br><i><span style=\"border-bottom: solid;\">To Dream Is to Act</span></i><br><br>In Le Guin’s novella, the Athsheans do not distinguish between dream-time and world-time. We echo this belief in our exhibition. All human beings share the ability to dream. Dreams mean. They are poems; reflections of disorganized thoughts; vivid, terrifying nocturnal episodes; experiences arising during sleep.  <br><br>The Athsheans dismantle any hierarchy between the real and the dreamt. Their radical idea pushes dreaming beyond mere speculation and solidifies it as equally valuable to our experiences in waking life. This practice is reflected in some of the artworks in the exhibition where the artist uses dreams as their guide to render tangible objects. It is the dreamers’ job to determine how to make use of their dreams and not dismiss the irrational simply because it may require decoding. While dreaming is often defined as an involuntary act, <i>The Word for World is Forest</i> asks to rethink it as a practice that should be cultivated and utilized. <br><br>What is a hallucination if not another strand of dreaming? This is dreaming that is self-induced through substances or resulting from extreme exhaustion. It can be no coincidence that the body produces visions after extreme amounts of pressure. For this Wattis presentation, Candice Lin’s <i>Witness (Blue Version)</i> and <i>(Yellow Version)</i> (both 2019) come to us from this sacred space. Lin conjured her own hallucinations by dosing herself with herbal tinctures.The tapestry worn as a yellow coat by one of the <i>Witness</i> figures is made from a drawing done under the influence of Datura metel (datura, devil’s trumpet), and the pattern for the blue coat was created under the influence of <i>Papaver somniferum</i> (opium poppy). Lin’s practice reaches beyond just possibilities. The ability of plants to have psychoactive effects on our consciousness is an example of intricacies of relationships across species. Her work takes into account the very real histories of migration and control, and the ways that race, gender, and economics shape our world. The masks worn by the <i>Witness</i> figures, which elicit medieval masks of shame, evoke dehumanization through humiliation. <br><br>Allison Smith enters a similar dream-like space through focused meditation. Instead of using plants, Smith uses carefully crafted devices that amplify her introspective state. Her sculptures titled <i>Ritual Instruments for Addressing 400 Years of Trouble (Harms Done, Harm None)</i> (2019–2020) are handmade objects that facilitate an attempt to heal the pain and grief caused by the artist’s ancestors. With unique personal stories, these objects provide a meditative space for the audience, often ready to be activated through private rituals. Her glass hearing trumpets take form as facilitators for deep listening. With these objects, Smith intends to make herself open to messages and visions that come from a deeper, practiced consciousness. Visitors to the exhibition are welcome to bring their ear to this instrument and engage in deliberate listening. <br><br>Similarly, the form of Smith’s urn-shaped instrument came to her in a vision. Rendered in ceramic, the urn is a physical manifestation of a form she was holding while receiving an ancestral transmission in a trance-like state of lucid dreaming: simultaneously a funerary urn, a baby, and the symbol we use in contemporary digital society as the podcast icon. By bringing visions like this into three-dimensional forms that can be used in ritual, the artist deepens a reciprocal relationship with the otherworldly to aid her confrontation with a complicated ancestral history. (4)<br>  <br>These works suggest that we can only begin to enact change in the world when we allow ourselves to dream. <br><br><i><span style=\"border-bottom: solid;\">Gathering There, Assembling Here</span></i><br><br>Beatriz Cortez’s <i>Shields</i> (2019) take the shape of three geodesic domes that occupy the gallery. Viewers are invited to crawl inside each of these tent-like structures. Made out of recycled materials, these sculptures both suggest nomadism as a choice for a future that echoes certain Indigenous ways of living, while raising awareness around the precarity of forced displacement and detention, alongside an unsustainable contemporary housing system. While Cortez’s domes offer a type of shelter, their material form ultimately negates their intended purpose. The steel and car hood metal that comprises these Shields makes them impossible for one person to lift alone. Their small size barely allows for a person to lie down. While <i>Shields</i> ultimately is not a sustainable housing structure, it does demonstrate a thinking toward alternatives for the future. <i>Shields</i> acknowledges the urgency required in the midst of a nationwide housing crisis, perhaps most prominently in San Francisco and the Bay Area.<br><br>Another two works in Smith’s <i>Instrument</i> series, which she refers to as Goddexx statues, are mounted sculptures made from found materials: a rock, sculpted by nature and found on a beach on an island off the coast of Maine, and lumpen metal, sculpted by a Northern California wildfire. By gathering and assembling these materials to create upright objects of worship of nonbinary orientation, Smith alters the notion of a divine feminine. These ready-made genderqueer statues draw on associations with historical “goddess” figures. To Smith, the statues represent a yearning for a pre-patriarchal symbiosis with nature, as well as a return to an ancient religious devotion to the natural world—a devotion that existed prior to the trouble caused by European migration and colonization of the new world.(5) Smith’s European lineage migrated to North America and became settler colonizers—a fact that Smith also openly acknowledges in her work. Her objects carry the tension of migrative encounters and complicated histories, while also providing a hope for curative objects with the potential to heal past, present, and future generations.<br><br>As for the Indigenous community in <i>The Word for World is Forest</i>, histories of oppression and colonization cannot be forgotten even as we attempt to return to a decolonized understanding of our relationship to the planet.(6) Despite the atrocities of our past, we can all recognize their existence and create something better. We can investigate ways to build on top, to replant displaced knowledge, and to cultivate new ideas within the soil that has already been tilled. The world as we know it may not need to be thrown away just to see something new.<br><br><br><span style=\"border-bottom: solid;\">Endnotes</span><br><br>(1) Candice Lin and Patrick Staff, <a href=\"https://walkerart.org/magazine/candice-lin-patrick-staff-hormonal-fog\" target=\"new\'\">“Reading And Smoking: Candice Lin and Patrick Staff on the Malleable Body,”</a> <i>Walker Reader</i>, October 1, 2019.<br>(2) Donna J.
