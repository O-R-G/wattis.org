About the Wattis . . .<br/><br/></span>

<div class="listContainer doublewide times big black">The CCA Wattis 
Institute</a> is a nonprofit exhibition venue and research institute 
dedicated to contemporary art. It was founded in 1998, at the <a 
href="http://www.cca.edu"> California College of the Arts</a> in San 
Francisco.

<br/><br/> The Wattis asks itself three (related) questions: What are artists making today? What are artists 
thinking about today? And how do artists inform (or disrupt) the way we think today?

<br/><br/> These are not easy questions, and to address each one 
requires time, attention, risk, and commitment. And so we prefer to work 
through them by working with one artist at a time. 

<br/><br/> The gallery presents exhibitions of one artistâ€™s work, or 
that are curated by one artist. The apartment hosts one artist on a 
research residency. And the work of one artist inspires a year-long 
program of events and a publication.

<br/><br/> With that, we know we can contribute something meaningful to 
the local, national, and international conversation about art and 
contemporary culture.

<br/><br/> And for the arts community in the Bay Area, we also opened 
*Next Door* in 2014, a place for discussions, events, and drinks.

<br/><br/><i> Our main idea is to spend more time with art, more time with artists, and
more time with each other.</i>
