Intern at the Wattis . . .<br/><br/></span>

<span class="listContainer times show comment"> 
Being an intern at the Wattis is an opportunity to experience a 
contemporary arts institution firsthand.<br/><br/>

There is no set application deadline for an internship, and inquiries 
are welcome throughout the year. We offer internships roughly coinciding 
with each academic term (January to May and September to December) and 
over the summer (June through August). The internships are designed to 
cover a three-month period, with a minimum commitment of three days per 
week. Internships are unpaid and no stipends are available, although 
academic credit may be an alternative option.<br/><br/>
