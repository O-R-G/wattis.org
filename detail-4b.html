<p>
He is not true to one medium. But nomadic, and borrows methods and devices from cultural theory, 
film, and poetry. Dysfunctionality and disorder are keys, and the paintings hung around the body as a cultural 
construct, as an incessantly actualized site at which the subject is constituted both in its identity and its 
instability and transversality.
</p>
<p>
The body of Schinwald’s work to date is multi-medial, and includes sculptures, manipulated clothing, paintings, 
films, marionettes, performances, altered historical prints and site-specific installations. Since 1999, 
Schinwald has also worked collaboratively with dancer Oleg Soulimenko on the Stage Matrix series, which has 
been performed at, among others, Performa 07, Moderna Museet, and the Tanzquartier, Vienna.
