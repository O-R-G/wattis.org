We are pleased to present Wattis Collectibles, a program of limited 
edition works. This series, conceived in conjunction with the Wattis 
exhibition and residency program, affords an opportunity to own works by 
some of today's most internationally significant emerging and 
established artists.<br /><br />

For the Fall of 2012, artists who have historic ties to the institution 
were asked to create new works to support the Wattis' transition into a 
new location. Seminal artists John Baldessari, Mark Bradford, Jonathan 
Monk, Paulina Olowska, and Laura Owens, have created new works 
exclusively for the Wattis, available on a first come first serve basis.<br /><br />

For direct sales, additional information or to be added to the Wattis 
Collectibles mailing list, please contact Micki Meng at mmeng@cca.edu or 
415.703.9521. Proceeds directly support the ongoing realization of the 
Wattis' exhibition program.<br /><br />
