    Há»“-Ã‚n TrÆ°Æ¡ng --> Hồng-Ân Trương
    Ã± --> ñ
    Há»“ng-Ã‚n TrÆ°Æ¡ng --> Hồng-Ân Trương
    Ã© --> é
    ØµØ±Ø®Ø© Ø´Ù…Ø³ÙŠØ© --> صرخة شمسية

+ /?random should start out not blank (letters white), 
  but showing letters plus punctuation
- fix /?random css and update toggleColor() as necc
+ menu should not have both Read About Us and About (remove About)
- add /calendar filter by "on our mind" and "our program"
  (looking at what parent record)
+ add space between columns for /calendar (and wherever else) in views/list
+ review 3-columns here (for example) which use css columns
  /on-our-mind/cecilia-vicua-a-is-on-our-mind-2020-2021
  likely better inline-block with /// as column separator
- trigger sound on every href (in process but not working in static/js/ui.js)'
  sound needs to finish playing before the href link is followed
+ debug /search to look in Notes (etc)
  currently it doesnt seem to be searching Notes field. not sure if correctly
  searching body, so to look into and make sure it is working as expected
- add / use Notes field as keywords for search
  this only means that for example you could add a term in there on a record
  and search would then find that record, so if searching Notes then
  this should work
- o-r-g clean up any extra <br> at the tops of columns of text, 
  for example, here:
  /read-about-us

- o-r-g instructions (victor to do based on

  referring to ICA version, adding whatever needs to be added specific
  to wattis
