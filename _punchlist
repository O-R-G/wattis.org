  a bear! first looking more into encoding from above encoding fix 
  in the end, i did find and replace in database dump from 
  wattis_staging.sql, replacing:
    â€“ --> –
    Há»“-Ã‚n TrÆ°Æ¡ng --> Hồng-Ân Trương
    Ã± --> ñ
    Há»“ng-Ã‚n TrÆ°Æ¡ng --> Hồng-Ân Trương
    Ã© --> é
    ØµØ±Ø®Ø© Ø´Ù…Ø³ÙŠØ© --> صرخة شمسية
+ /?random should start out not blank (letters white), 
  but showing letters plus punctuation
+ fix /?random css and update toggleColor() as necc
+ menu should not have both Read About Us and About (remove About)
    - update ranks of menu items on staging:
      our program --> 10
      calendar    --> 15
+ add space between columns for /calendar (and wherever else) in views/list
+ review 3-columns here (for example) which use css columns
  /on-our-mind/cecilia-vicua-a-is-on-our-mind-2020-2021
  likely better inline-block with /// as column separator
+ debug /search to look in Notes (etc)
  currently it doesnt seem to be searching Notes field. not sure if correctly
  searching body, so to look into and make sure it is working as expected
+ add / use Notes field as keywords for search
  this only means that for example you could add a term in there on a record
  and search would then find that record, so if searching Notes then
  this should work
+ o-r-g clean up any extra <br> at the tops of columns of text, 
  for example, here:
  /read-about-us
    solved by remove nl2br(). Possibily need to check if it messes up some layout somewhere
+ trigger sound on every href (in process but not working in static/js/ui.js)'
  sound needs to finish playing before the href link is followed
  achieved by simply using the click event as the handler   
+ o-r-g instructions (victor to do based on 
  https://github.com/O-R-G/open-records-generator/blob/master/readme.md
  referring to ICA version, adding whatever needs to be added specific
  to wattis
+ add /calendar filter by "on our mind" and "our program"
  (looking at what parent record)
    the children of calendar seem to be just children of calendar instead 
    fetched from oom and op?
  will depend on _Events which is under specific On our mind season or 
  On view exhibition. here is an example:    
  http://wattis.o-r-g.net/open-records-generator/browse/on-our-mind/joan-jonas-is-on-our-mind-2014-2015/events
  wattis will link these for all other events, so just need to adjust code
  to filter on the ancestors of these linked records
+ update all o-r-g records from .org since migration (see /readme.md for notes)
+ current accurate best database is on .local
  this should be the same as remote but just in case
+ reconcile media 
+ fix line returns between paragraphs in db (using nl2br in views/view)  
+ reconcile On our mind
+ fix all accents in Reading list in Library
+ add _Events to On our mind (at least Joan Jonas)
+ replace wattis.org/ links with relative in sql 
+ menu 
+ fix views/view.php to show /our-program etc correctly 
  now that it is moved in o-r-g
+ o-r-g default to html view
+ fix adding record to News (which does not work currently)
+ adjust urls
  + /our-program/gallery --> /our-program/on-view
    o-r-g, .htaccess, .sql
  x /main --> /menu
+ force /main/whatever to redirect to /whatever
  for some reason, this does not work, perhaps to do with order:
  RewriteRule ^main/(.*) /$1 [NC,L]
  but this does:
  Redirect 301 /main/ /
+ fix window close x in image gallery
+ /calendar should by default show all items -- on-view, and on-our-mind
  then work only as filters for the selected dates
  this is different from how they work in /library
  should these be styled differently as are mode selectors not filters
+ mobile css check, adjust
+ clean up / confirm / test o-r-g html default view; add logic to master;
  delete html branch
+ /calendar throws an error when filter for on-view but no on-view available
  just stops loading the page 
+ ON OUR MIND and ON VIEW to upper and lowercase so they appear smaller
+ /calendar mobile filer css review, clean up
