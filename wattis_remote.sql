Sueda is a Graphic Design professor at CCA and founder of the San Francisco design practice Stripe. Wide White Space is the second installment in The Way Beyond Art, a series of exhibitions at the Wattis that closely integrates the institute\'s programs with CCA\'s non-fine arts faculty and curricula.\r\n\r\nThe title Wide White Space refers to the name of a radical art space in Antwerp that, though it existed for only a decade, came to define contemporary art in the late 1960s and early 1970s. This exhibition likewise aims to investigate the possibilities for how empty space, whether the white cube or the blank page, can be transformed into something more complex. The name of the larger program, The Way Beyond Art, refers to the title of a book written by the visionary German art historian Alexander Dorner, who advocated in the early 20th century for a closer dialogue among different artistic disciplines. He is best known for his collaboration with the Constructivist artist El Lissitzky on the Abstract Cabinet (1927) at the Landesmuseum Hannover, Germany, a unique, specially constructed space that explored a new form of multidisciplinarity produced by juxtaposing art, fashion, design, film, and literature.\r\n\r\nThis catalog was produced by Jon Sueda / Stripe.',NULL),(49,1,'2014-07-27 16:11:56','2014-07-27 18:36:58',50,'Give Them the Picture',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',NULL,NULL,'2014-07-27 20:11:00',NULL,NULL,'Graduate Program in Curatorial Practice at CCA and CCA Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts, 2011\r\nPaperback, 203 pages\r\n$20.00','Give Them the Picture is a literary extension of the Curatorial Practice thesis exhibition currently on view in the Wattis.

She is here with us—coming in and out—from September to next January. She is using this opportunity to explore some of her current research interests and to involve and invite other artists and peers to contribute.\r\n\r\nHer departure point is a scene from <i>Les Demoiselles de Rochefort,</i> a 1967 musical film by Jacques Demy, starring Catherine Deneuve and Gene Kelly. In several scenes of the film, Demy uses artworks as props to help build his characters and their relationships to the world.  The objects perform their role as works of art, and are treated as such by the film\'s characters, all the while being nothing more than stage props, proxies, or avatars for the real thing. \r\n\r\nBaghrmamian proposes that the very nature of an artwork or of exhibition is a prop or a proxy for a web of real objects, real people, and real relationships. Only relevant to a particular place at a particular point in time—like a painting making a brief and potentially ambivalent appearance in a movie—the prop constitutes both an acknowledgement as well as a rejection of the curatorial act. \r\n\r\nShe begins her residency by inviting Paulina Olowska to show a painting and Adam Linder to perform. \r\n\r\n',NULL),(85,1,'2014-07-29 17:41:59','2014-08-08 07:33:35',10,'Joan Jonas',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',NULL,'2014-09-09 00:00:00','2015-05-31 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,'','<a href=\"\">Joan Jonas</a> is on our mind. \r\n\r\nShe is a pioneer of video and performance art—her early work from the 1960s and 70s anticipated the following forty years of multi-media. \r\n\r\n<i>De-synchronization, usually in conjunction with fragmentation and repetition</i> was Douglas Crimp’s crisp and eloquent summary of her work. Jonas cuts up and displaces elements from dance, theater, myth, landscape, and media to tell abstract stories. The parts of the whole are the parts of the piece—the projection, the performer, the set, the sound. She examines space and perceptual phenomena from gendered perspectives.\r\n\r\n<i>I explore the place of women in history as outsiders – healers – witches – storytellers</i>, she says.\r\n\r\n.*+\r\n\r\n<i>A interdisciplinary research group of CCA faculty members reflect on the work of Joan Jonas for the entire 2014-15 academic year.

The exhibition features such work as a rat cage within a rat cage, a tractor-like torture device emblematic of the inescapable force of death, and a portrait cast in deep anguish. A standout piece is an installation by Andra Ursuta. From Romania, her works are vulgar and dark, focusing on elegiac themes such as death and somber childhood memories. Stoner (2013) constructs a violent and perverse scene: a baseball pitching machine supplied with handcrafted stones are hurled towards a tiled wall representative of human flesh. The machine carries out a barbaric exercise ? the punishment or final silence of its victim.
