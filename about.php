<div class="programContainer times big black" style="width:50%;"> <span 
id="sentence5"><a href="detail-17.html">The CCA Wattis Institute</a> is 
a nonprofit exhibition venue and research institute dedicated to 
contemporary art. It was founded in 1998, at the <a 
href="http://www.cca.edu"> California College of the Arts</a> in San 
Francisco. 

<br/><br/> The Wattis asks itself three (related) questions: 
What are artists making today? What are artists thinking about today? 
And how do artists inform (or disrupt) the way we think today? 

<br/><br/> These are not easy questions, and to address each one 
requires time, attention, risk, and commitment. And so we prefer to work 
through them by working with one artist at a time. 

<br/><br/> The gallery presents exhibitions of one artistâ€™s work, or 
that are curated by one artist. The apartment hosts one artist on a 
research residency. And the work of one artist inspires a year-long 
program of events and a publication.

<br/><br/> With that, we know we can contribute something meaningful to 
the local, national, and international conversation about art and 
contemporary culture.

<br/><br/> And for the arts community in the Bay Area, we also opened 
*Next Door* in 2014, a place for discussions, events, and drinks.

<br/><br/><i> Our main idea is to spend more time with art, more time with artists, and
more time with each other.</i>
