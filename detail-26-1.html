Joan Jonas, Glass puzzle (1973) 
</span><br /><br />

We are showing two films by Joan Jonas Next Door on starting at 6pm. The 
total running time is 1 hour and 32 minutes.<br /><br />

<span class="listContainer times show comment">

The first film is <i>Glass puzzle</i>. This complex and enigmatic work, 
which is performed by Jonas and Lois Lane, explores female gestures, 
poses, the body and narcissism. Mirroring each other with synchronized 
movements as they perform as alter-egos, Jonas and Lane reference 
archetypal female gestures and poses from popular and traditional 
cultures. Throughout the performance, space is dislocated and altered as 
a formal device â€” segmented by a swinging bar, superimposed in layers. 
With its evocative personal theater and idiosyncratic vocabulary of 
gestures, ritual and symbolism, Glass Puzzle is a quintessential Jonas 
work.<br /><br />

The second film, also by Jonas, will be a surprise. See you then.
