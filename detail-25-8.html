<i>Give Them the Picture</i> is a literary extension of the Curatorial 
Practice thesis exhibition currently on view in the Wattis. Rather than 
a traditional exhibition catalog, it is an anthology of essays taken 
from <i>La Mamelle</i> and <i>ART COM</i> magazines. It collects and places in 
dialogue 24 articles penned by critics and artists such as <i>La Mamelle / 
ART COM</i> founder Carl Loeffler, Lynn Hershman, Richard Irwin, Anna Couey, 
and Linda Montano, plus interviews with artists such as Douglas Davis 
and Eleanor Antin.<br /><br />

This collection represents the complexity of the ideas presented in the 
exhibition as they were grappled with at the time of their original 
publication, and it also positions them as contemporary questions; 
particularly relevant is the mediation of performance. It also features 
conversations between the curators and two of La Mamelle / ART COM's key 
figures, Nancy Frank and Darlene Tong.<br /><br />

Give Them the Picture is a co-publication between the CCA Wattis 
Institute for Contemporary Arts and the Graduate Program in Curatorial 
Practice. Generous support for God Only Knows Who the Audience Is: 
Performance, Video, and Television Through the Lens of La Mamelle / ART 
COM has been provided by the Live Oak Foundation and Roger & Victoria 
Sant. Designed by Jon Sueda / Stripe.<br /><br />
